# Conclusions

This thesis has addressed the growing need for specialized bioinformatics tools capable of leveraging the unique advantages of long-read sequencing for cancer genomics, particularly in clinical and research settings where only a tumor sample is available. The central contribution of this work is the development and validation of LongPhase-TO, a novel tumor-only analysis pipeline designed to provide a comprehensive, haplotype-resolved view of the somatic landscape. By integrating advanced phasing algorithms with graph-based modeling, this research demonstrates a new paradigm for extracting multi-layered genomic information from a single tumor specimen, thereby overcoming significant limitations of conventional methods.

The key findings of this study underscore the multifaceted capabilities of LongPhase-TO. First, the pipeline achieves accurate somatic phasing, enabling the assignment of somatic mutations to their specific parental chromosome of origin. This capability remains robust even in complex genomic regions, including those undergoing Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), providing unprecedented resolution into the allelic context of carcinogenesis. Second, LongPhase-TO facilitates the reliable detection of large, chromosome-scale LOH events, with performance comparable to established array-based standards while avoiding the fragmentation issues that can plague other sequencing-based approaches. Third, by leveraging this phasing information, the pipeline significantly enhances the precision of somatic variant calling, a benefit that is particularly pronounced in challenging cases characterized by low tumor purity. Finally, LongPhase-TO introduces a method for accurately estimating tumor purity directly from the sequencing data by analyzing signals of haplotype imbalance and LOH, thereby obviating the need for a matched normal sample and streamlining the analytical workflow.

The implications of this research are significant for both basic cancer biology and clinical oncology. For fundamental research, a haplotype-resolved analysis of the tumor genome offers deeper insights into the mechanisms of tumor evolution, including the specific allelic context of driver mutations and the clonal dynamics of LOH events. From a clinical perspective, the ability to perform robust, comprehensive genomic analysis from a tumor-only sample enhances the utility of long-read sequencing in diagnostic and prognostic settings where obtaining a matched normal sample is impractical or impossible. By delivering reliable LOH detection, improved variant calling, and accurate purity estimation within a single, integrated pipeline, LongPhase-TO is established as a cost-effective and broadly applicable tool for precision medicine.

While this work establishes a powerful new methodology, several avenues for future research can extend its capabilities and applications. Promising directions include the validation of LongPhase-TO across a broader spectrum of cancer types and a larger cohort of patient samples to further assess its generalizability and performance. The pipeline can also be extended to characterize other classes of complex structural variants, such as balanced translocations and chromothripsis, which are increasingly recognized for their role in cancer. Furthermore, integrating LongPhase-TO with other omics data, such as transcriptomics or epigenomics, could provide a more holistic understanding of how genetic and epigenetic alterations cooperate in a haplotype-specific manner to drive tumorigenesis. Such advancements will continue to build upon the foundation laid by this thesis, further unlocking the potential of long-read sequencing to transform our understanding and treatment of cancer.
