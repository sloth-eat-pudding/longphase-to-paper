The accurate identification of genetic variants from sequencing data is a cornerstone of modern genomics, underpinning research in human disease, population genetics, and clinical diagnostics. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies, developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), has substantially advanced the field. While historically challenged by higher per-base error rates compared to short-read platforms, long reads offer the distinct advantage of spanning large, repetitive, or complex genomic regions, with the crucial capability of linking multiple variant sites on a single molecule. This has spurred the development of novel computational methods designed to harness this long-range information. This chapter reviews the state of the art in variant calling, tracing the evolution of methods from germline variant discovery to the more complex challenge of identifying somatic mutations in cancer genomics.

A fundamental task in genomics is the characterization of an individual's germline variantsâ€”the inherited genetic makeup. For diploid organisms, this process involves not only identifying heterozygous variants but also resolving their phase, which entails determining which variants co-occur on the same parental chromosome to reconstruct two distinct haplotypes. Long-read sequencing is exceptionally well-suited for phasing, as a single multi-kilobase read can physically link multiple heterozygous sites, providing direct evidence of their cis or trans configuration. However, the higher error profiles of long-read data present a significant challenge, as random sequencing errors can be mistaken for true, low-frequency variants. To overcome this, modern variant callers have largely moved beyond simple consensus-based approaches in favor of sophisticated statistical models. Leading tools such as `DeepVariant` and `Clair3` employ deep learning, typically using convolutional or recurrent neural networks, to analyze raw read pileups. These models are trained to learn the distinct statistical signatures of true genetic variants versus the characteristic patterns of random sequencing errors, thereby enabling highly accurate genotype calls and effectively separating biological signal from technological noise.

Building on these foundations, the field has addressed the more complex problem of identifying somatic mutations: genetic alterations acquired by cells during an organism's lifetime that are primary drivers of cancer. The gold-standard approach for somatic variant calling involves a paired analysis of a tumor sample and a matched normal sample from the same individual. By systematically comparing the two, variants present only in the tumor can be confidently identified as somatic. The advantages of long reads and phasing are particularly salient in this context. A somatic mutation often arises on only one of the two parental chromosomes and may be present in just a fraction of the cells within a heterogeneous tumor. Phasing the tumor reads segregates the somatic allele onto its specific haplotype, which effectively concentrates its signal and distinguishes it from the wild-type allele and randomly distributed sequencing errors. This principle is leveraged by state-of-the-art somatic callers like `DeepSomatic`, `ClairS`, and `Severus`, which integrate information from the tumor-normal comparison with phased read data to achieve superior sensitivity and precision, especially for variants with low allele frequencies.

In many clinical and research settings, a matched normal sample is unavailable due to logistical or financial constraints, necessitating a tumor-only calling strategy. This scenario presents a considerable analytical challenge: distinguishing a rare somatic mutation from a rare germline variant without a patient-specific baseline. To address this, current workflows often substitute the matched normal with a Panel of Normals (PON). A PON is a curated database of variants and artifacts derived from a large cohort of healthy individuals, which serves as a filter to remove common germline polymorphisms and recurrent technology-specific errors. Even in this more ambiguous context, phasing the tumor's long reads remains a critical step for amplifying the signal of true somatic events. Specialized tools and modes, such as `DeepSomatic(TO)`, `ClairS-TO`, and `Severus(TO)`, have been developed specifically for this purpose. These methods adapt the deep learning frameworks of their paired-analysis counterparts by incorporating PON-based filtering, enabling robust somatic variant detection from a single tumor sample. This progression from germline to paired-somatic and, finally, to tumor-only workflows underscores a pivotal trend in the field: the strategic integration of long-range phasing information with advanced machine learning models is essential for overcoming the inherent challenges of long-read data and achieving high-confidence variant discovery.
