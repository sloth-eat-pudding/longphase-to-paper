# Results

This chapter presents the empirical evaluation of the developed methodologies for analyzing tumor-only long-read sequencing data. The results are structured to first establish the superiority of a somatic-aware phasing approach, followed by an in-depth analysis of its application to key downstream tasks, including Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) detection, somatic variant calling refinement, and tumor purity estimation. The chapter concludes with qualitative visualizations that demonstrate the power of the integrated pipeline in resolving complex genomic events within cancer samples.

## Superiority of Somatic-Aware Phasing for Tumor-Only Data

A fundamental prerequisite for analyzing allele-specific events in tumors is the accurate phasing of heterozygous variants into parental haplotypes. To establish the most suitable approach for this task, we compared the performance of a standard germline phaser, `LongPhase`, with our proposed somatic-aware phaser, `LongPhase-TO`. Both tools were tested on eight cancer cell line datasets, using variant calls generated by `ClairS-TO` in two different modes (`ssrs` and `ss`) as input&nbsp;[@van2013; @byrskabishop2022; @anders2015]. Performance was assessed based on phasing completeness (Phased Ratio) and contiguity (Block N50).

The results demonstrate a clear and significant advantage for the somatic-aware `LongPhase-TO` tool. The first comparative analysis shows that `LongPhase-TO` consistently achieves a higher Phased Ratio across all eight cell line samples, irrespective of the input variant set. The somatic-aware pipelines (represented by light teal and light blue bars in the corresponding figure) successfully phased approximately 50-60% of heterozygous variants, whereas the standard germline `LongPhase` tool (green and dark blue bars) exhibited lower and more variable performance. This indicates that the model underlying `LongPhase-TO` is better equipped to handle the complexities of tumor genomes, such as variable allele frequencies and the presence of somatic mutations, leading to more comprehensive phasing.

This superiority is even more pronounced when considering phasing contiguity, a critical metric for the analysis of large-scale genomic events. A second analysis reveals a dramatic difference in Block N50 values. The `LongPhase-TO` pipelines produced highly contiguous phase blocks, with N50 values frequently ranging between 10 and 25 million base pairs (Mbp). In stark contrast, the germline `LongPhase` tool consistently failed to generate long-range phase information, with Block N50 values typically falling below 1 Mbp. This vast improvement in contiguity underscores the necessity of a somatic-aware model for reconstructing long, continuous haplotypes from tumor sequencing data. The ability to generate such long-range phase blocks is essential for accurately identifying structural variations like LOH. In summary, these findings validate the use of `LongPhase-TO` as the core phasing engine for all subsequent analyses in this study.

## Application and Validation of Phasing for LOH Detection

Having established the superior phasing capabilities of `LongPhase-TO`, we next evaluated its direct application in detecting Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), a common and significant event in cancer&nbsp;[@gnocchini2022; @mcmahon2024; @yang2011]. This evaluation involved two stages: first, optimizing the input for the LOH detection pipeline, and second, validating the final pipeline against a gold-standard orthogonal technology.

### Impact of Input Somatic Variant Calls on LOH Detection

The quality of phasing, and consequently LOH detection, is dependent on the quality of the input variant calls. We therefore compared the performance of the LOH detection pipeline when supplied with variants from three different upstream somatic calling pipelines: `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)`, `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)`, and `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)`&nbsp;[@del2022; @jin2022; @arora2019]. The comparison was performed across eight cancer cell line samples, assessing both the total genomic fraction identified as LOH (LOH Ratio) and the size of the largest contiguous phased block.

The results indicate that the choice of the upstream variant caller significantly influences LOH detection outcomes. The pipelines utilizing `ClairS-TO-ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO` as inputs consistently identified a higher LOH Ratio across most samples compared to the pipeline using `ClairS-TO-ss`. For instance, in the HCC1395 and HCC1937 cell lines, the former two pipelines detected LOH across approximately 50% of the genome, while the latter detected a substantially smaller fraction. This suggests that the `ssrs` mode of `ClairS-TO` and the tumor-only mode of `DeepSomatic` provide a more comprehensive set of heterozygous variants for phasing.

This quantitative superiority was matched by a qualitative improvement in contiguity. When examining the size of the largest phased block, the `ClairS-TO-ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO` input pipelines again outperformed the `ClairS-TO-ss` pipeline. For example, in the COLO829 sample, they identified a largest contiguous block of approximately 110 Mbp, compared to around 100 Mbp for the `ClairS-TO-ss`-based pipeline. This demonstrates that a better input variant set not only increases the total amount of detected LOH but also enables the reconstruction of longer, more contiguous LOH regions. These findings highlight the critical importance of the input variant caller and support the use of `ClairS-TO-ssrs` or `DeepSomatic-TO` for robust LOH analysis.

### Validation Against Microarray-Based LOH Profiles

To validate the accuracy of our sequencing-based LOH detection method, we performed a head-to-head comparison against results from the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array, a widely used and well-established microarray platform for detecting copy number alterations and LOH&nbsp;[@garciadiez2019]. This analysis was conducted on the HCC1395_HKU cancer cell line, with LOH calls from our `LongPhase-TO` pipeline compared against the CytoScan HD reference across the entire genome.

A genome-wide visualization, presenting each chromosome from 1 to 22, $X$, and $Y$, reveals a remarkably high level of concordance between the two methods. For each chromosome, the LOH regions detected by the `LongPhase-TO` pipeline (represented by blue bars in the corresponding figure) show near-perfect overlap with the LOH regions detected by the CytoScan HD array (purple bars). This strong agreement is evident across numerous chromosomes, including large-scale events on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, and $X$. The long, contiguous LOH blocks identified by `LongPhase-TO` are a direct manifestation of its superior long-range phasing capability. This visual validation provides compelling evidence that the `LongPhase-TO`-based methodology accurately identifies known, large-scale LOH events, confirming its efficacy and reliability as a tool for LOH analysis from tumor-only long-read sequencing data.

## Refining Somatic Variant Calls with Phasing Information

Beyond LOH detection, haplotype information can be leveraged to refine the accuracy of upstream somatic variant calling&nbsp;[@zhou2024]. We investigated the impact of integrating `LongPhase-TO` as a post-processing filter for somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls. This was assessed by comparing the performance of base callers with and without the `LongPhase-TO` refinement step, using models trained on both real and simulated data.

### Performance on Models Trained with Real Data

We first evaluated the impact of `LongPhase-TO` on two state-of-the-art somatic callers, `ClairS-TO-ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO`, using models trained on real sequencing data. The performance of four pipelines—the two base callers alone and the two in combination with `LongPhase-TO`—was benchmarked across eight cancer cell line datasets at varying levels of simulated tumor purity (20% to 100%). Performance was measured using the F1-score, precision, and recall.

The results, presented in a comprehensive grid of performance plots, show that applying `LongPhase-TO` as a filter has a distinct and significant effect on each base caller. For `ClairS-TO-ssrs`, the addition of `LongPhase-TO` consistently improves both precision and the overall F1-score across nearly all datasets and purity levels. This indicates that `LongPhase-TO` acts as an effective filter, removing false positives from the `ClairS-TO-ssrs` call set and thereby increasing its overall accuracy. The `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` combination emerged as a top-performing pipeline.

In contrast, the interaction with `DeepSomatic-TO` highlighted a classic precision-recall trade-off&nbsp;[@weber2020; @kuo2023; @cosentino2019]. `DeepSomatic-TO` alone exhibited very high recall but suffered from poor precision. Integrating `LongPhase-TO` dramatically improved its precision, but at the cost of a substantial reduction in recall. This over-correction resulted in a lower F1-score compared to `DeepSomatic-TO` alone. This suggests that while `LongPhase-TO` can effectively refine call sets, its stringency may be better matched to callers like `ClairS-TO-ssrs`. As expected, the performance of all tested pipelines generally improved with increasing tumor purity, as the higher proportion of tumor DNA makes somatic variants more readily distinguishable from the germline background. These results validate `LongPhase-TO` as a powerful refinement tool that can enhance the accuracy of somatic variant calling.

### Characterization of the Precision-Recall Trade-off using Simulation-Trained Models

To further investigate the filtering characteristics of `LongPhase-TO`, we conducted a similar benchmark using a variant caller (`ClairS-TO-ss`) trained on simulated data. This controlled experiment allows for a clear characterization of the precision-recall dynamics when `LongPhase-TO` is applied as a post-processing step. The performance of `ClairS-TO-ss` with and without `LongPhase-TO` was evaluated across the same eight datasets and purity levels.

The results unequivocally demonstrate that `LongPhase-TO` functions as a precision-enhancing filter. Across all eight datasets, the combined `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` pipeline achieved significantly higher precision compared to `ClairS-TO-ss` alone. This improvement, however, was consistently accompanied by a decrease in recall, confirming that the filtering process removes some true positive variants alongside false positives. The net effect on the F1-score, which balances precision and recall, was context-dependent. In datasets where the baseline precision of `ClairS-TO-ss` was lower, the gain in precision from `LongPhase-TO` outweighed the loss in recall, resulting in a higher F1-score. In other cases, the trade-off was less favorable. This analysis confirms the role of `LongPhase-TO` as a valuable but conservative filter for somatic variant calls, offering a robust mechanism to increase confidence in the final call set.

## Accurate Tumor Purity Estimation from Tumor-Only Long-Read Data

An accurate estimate of tumor purity is a critical parameter for interpreting cancer genomics data&nbsp;[@choo2023; @koo2021; @zhang2015]. We assessed the capability of our `LongPhase-TO`-based pipelines to predict tumor purity directly from tumor-only long-read sequencing data. The purity estimates from three `LongPhase-TO` pipeline variants were compared against those from `Ascat`, a widely used tool that requires matched tumor-normal data, using simulated purity as the ground truth.

The evaluation, conducted across eight cancer cell line datasets, demonstrates the outstanding performance of the `LongPhase-TO`-based methods. In a series of scatter plots comparing estimated purity against simulated purity, the predictions from all three `LongPhase-TO` pipelines closely tracked the ideal prediction line ($y=x) across the full range of purity levels (20$% to 100%). This high accuracy was remarkably consistent across the different datasets and was largely independent of the specific upstream variant caller used (`ClairS-TO-ssrs`, `ClairS-TO-ss`, or `DeepSomatic-TO`), indicating the robustness of the purity estimation algorithm within `LongPhase-TO` itself. While exceptionally robust, the methods showed minor deviations from the ideal prediction line at the lowest simulated purity of 20%, highlighting the inherent challenges of analysis in low-purity samples, though their performance remained vastly superior to the alternative.

In sharp contrast, the `Ascat` method performed poorly and erratically in this context. It frequently produced highly inaccurate estimates, often predicting 100% purity for samples with a true purity of 20% or 40%. These results clearly establish that the `LongPhase-TO` framework provides a highly accurate and reliable method for tumor purity estimation from tumor-only long-read data, offering a significant advantage over existing methods that are either less accurate or require matched normal samples.

## Qualitative Demonstration of Haplotype-Resolved Variant Analysis

To complement the quantitative benchmarks, we present qualitative evidence from genome browser visualizations that showcase the unique analytical power of our integrated pipeline. These examples illustrate the ability to resolve the haplotype context of individual somatic mutations and complex structural events.

### Visualizing Haplotype-Resolved Somatic Variants

A key capability of our methodology is "haplotagging"—the assignment of a somatic variant to its specific parental chromosome of origin. A visualization from a cancer sample clearly demonstrates this process. In the displayed genomic region, long sequencing reads are successfully partitioned into two parental haplotypes (HP1 and HP2). A specific somatic variant is observed exclusively on a subset of reads belonging to Haplotype 2. These reads are further isolated into a distinct sub-haplotype track (HP2-1). This visualization provides unambiguous evidence that the somatic mutation occurred on the chromosome corresponding to Haplotype 2. Furthermore, its presence on only a subset of HP2 reads suggests the identification of a tumor sub-clone, highlighting the method's potential to resolve intra-tumor heterogeneity.

### Integrated Analysis of Co-occurring Somatic Alterations

Cancer genomes are often characterized by the co-occurrence of multiple types of alterations&nbsp;[@sanchezvega2018; @saiki2021; @canisius2016]. A second, more complex visualization demonstrates the pipeline'$s$ power to dissect such scenarios by simultaneously detecting and phasing a large-scale LOH event and a discrete somatic point mutation. In the displayed genome browser view, a large region on the left is clearly marked by a complete absence of sequencing reads assigned to Haplotype 1 (HP1), providing a definitive signature of LOH for that parental allele. To the right of this LOH region, the genome is heterozygous. Within this region, a specific somatic point variant is identified and precisely haplotagged. The variant is found exclusively on reads belonging to a sub-clonal population (HP2-1) of the retained Haplotype 2 (HP2).

This powerful example illustrates the capacity of the pipeline to reconstruct a complex mutational history: an LOH event resulted in the loss of the HP1 chromosomal segment, and a subsequent somatic mutation arose on the remaining HP2 chromosome within a specific sub-clone. This ability to resolve different classes of somatic events and place them in their correct haplotype context is critical for a deeper understanding of tumor evolution and genetic architecture.
