\section{Supplementary Methods}

\subsection{Detailed Algorithmic Implementation}

This section provides comprehensive details on the computational algorithms implemented in LongPhase-TO, including specific parameter settings, optimization strategies, and implementation considerations.

\subsubsection{CNV and BFB Interval Detection Parameters}

The detection of structural variant intervals relies on several key parameters that were empirically optimized:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Window size (w):} Set to 6 base pairs for the Forward Pileup calculation
\item \textbf{Amplitude threshold ($\lambda$):} 0.3 for signal enhancement
\item \textbf{Signal swing ratio ($\alpha$):} 0.7 for amplitude similarity
\item \textbf{Spatial proximity ($\beta$):} 50 base pairs maximum distance
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{LOH Detection Thresholds}

The chromosome-scale LOH detection employs the following empirically determined thresholds:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Heterozygosity ratio threshold ($\sigma$):} 0.09
\item \textbf{VAF threshold for homozygous classification:} 0.8
\item \textbf{Minimum LOH segment length:} 1 Mb
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Benchmarking Details}

\subsubsection{Computational Resources}

All analyses were performed on high-performance computing clusters with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item CPU: Intel Xeon processors with 24-48 cores
\item Memory: 128-256 GB RAM per node
\item Storage: High-speed SSD arrays
\item Runtime: 12-48 hours per sample depending on coverage
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Statistical Validation Methods}

The validation of LongPhase-TO performance employed several statistical approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Concordance Analysis:} Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and ground-truth values
\item \textbf{Precision-Recall Curves:} ROC analysis for variant calling accuracy
\item \textbf{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:} 95\% CI for purity estimation accuracy
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Multiple Variant Callers:} Validation using ClairS, DeepVariant, and custom pipelines
\item \textbf{Replicate Analysis:} Technical replicates to assess reproducibility
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clinical Sample Validation}

Preliminary validation on clinical samples demonstrated the practical applicability of LongPhase-TO:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sample Types:} Primary tumors, metastases, and circulating tumor DNA
\item \textbf{Purity Range:} 15-95\% tumor content
\item \textbf{Success Rate:} 89\% of samples yielded reliable phasing results
