# Introduction

Cancer is fundamentally a disease of the genome, initiated and propelled by the accumulation of somatic mutations. These acquired genetic alterations, which arise in a specific cell during an individual'$s$ lifetime, are distinct from the germline variants inherited from one'$s$ parents and present in every cell of the body. This distinction is paramount in oncology, as identifying the unique landscape of somatic mutations within a tumor is essential for elucidating its biological behavior, diagnosing its subtype, and selecting targeted therapies. While the advent of high-throughput sequencing has transformed cancer research by enabling the comprehensive cataloging of these mutations, a mere inventory of variants is insufficient. To fully comprehend their functional impact, it is necessary to resolve their chromosomal context, a process known as haplotype phasing.

Haplotype phasing is the computational process of assigning variants to their chromosome of origin, thereby reconstructing the distinct genetic sequences inherited from each parent. This resolution is critical because the functional consequence of multiple mutations is contingent upon whether they occur on the same chromosome copy (in *cis*) or on different copies (in *trans*). The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies has significantly advanced phasing capabilities. By generating reads that span tens of thousands of base pairs, these platforms can physically link numerous heterozygous variants on a single DNA molecule, facilitating the reconstruction of long, contiguous haplotype blocks. This technological leap has largely resolved the challenge of germline phasing, which aims to reconstruct the two stable, inherited haplotypes of an individual.

In the domain of germline variant analysis, sophisticated computational methods have been developed to leverage the power of long-read data. A key challenge in this field is distinguishing true genetic variants from the inherent noise of sequencing errors. State-of-the-art tools, such as DeepVariant and Clair3, employ deep learning models that analyze patterns in aligned sequencing reads to render highly accurate predictions, effectively separating the biological signal from technological artifacts. These methods first phase the reads into two haplotype-specific groups and subsequently supply this partitioned data to a neural network, demonstrating that phasing is a foundational step for achieving high-fidelity variant calling. This principle of utilizing phase information to enhance signal has been successfully extended to cancer genomics.

The gold standard for identifying somatic mutations has historically been the comparative analysis of paired tumor and normal samples from the same patient. This approach permits the direct subtraction of the germline background, thereby isolating variants unique to the tumor. Modern somatic variant callers designed for long-read data, including DeepSomatic, ClairS, and Severus, have adopted a phase-centric strategy. By first phasing the reads from the tumor sample, they concentrate the signal of a somatic mutation—which typically arises on a single haplotype—into one partition of the data. This segregation markedly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling machine learning models to more readily distinguish a low-frequency somatic variant from randomly distributed sequencing errors.

In many clinical and research settings, however, a matched normal sample is unavailable, which necessitates a "tumor-only" workflow. This scenario presents a significant analytical challenge: differentiating a true, low-frequency somatic mutation from a rare germline variant without a constitutional baseline from the same individual. The standard mitigation strategy involves filtering candidate variants against a Panel of Normals (PON), a database of common germline variants and recurrent technical artifacts compiled from a large cohort of healthy individuals. Although effective at removing many non-somatic variants, this approach still derives significant benefit from phasing. Specialized tumor-only callers like ClairS-TO continue to rely on phasing to amplify the somatic signal, underscoring its indispensable role even in the most challenging data contexts.

Despite these advances, a critical gap persists in the field: the inability of current tools to perform true *somatic phasing*. Existing methods excel at germline phasing *within* a tumor sample—that is, separating reads based on the two inherited parental haplotypes. However, they are incapable of reconstructing the novel, complex somatic haplotypes that are the products of a tumor'$s$ evolution. Cancer is a dynamic process characterized by clonal evolution, where successive rounds of mutation and selection give rise to a heterogeneous population of subclones, each possessing a unique genetic identity. Reconstructing the specific somatic haplotypes of these subclones is essential for understanding co-mutation patterns, tracing tumor lineage, and deciphering the cooperative mechanisms that drive malignancy. This represents a frontier in cancer genomics that current methodologies have yet to cross.

The path toward accurate somatic phasing is obstructed by two major biological and computational hurdles inherent to cancer genomes. The first is the prevalence of large-scale structural changes, particularly Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), where vast regions of a chromosome lose one of the two parental copies. Such events disrupt the continuity of heterozygous markers upon which standard algorithms depend, leading to algorithmic failure and the production of highly fragmented, biologically inaccurate phase blocks. Achieving contiguous, chromosome-scale phasing requires a framework that can explicitly model and navigate these genomic discontinuities. The second challenge is tumor purity; clinical tumor samples are almost invariably a mixture of cancer cells and contaminating normal cells. This cellular heterogeneity introduces conflicting haplotype signals into the sequencing data, which can severely confound phasing algorithms and result in a high frequency of "switch errors"—incorrect junctions between paternal and maternal haplotype segments.

This thesis aims to overcome these fundamental limitations by developing **LongPhase-TO**, an integrated computational framework for the comprehensive analysis of tumor-only long-read sequencing data. The primary objective is to advance beyond conventional variant calling to achieve true somatic phasing. Through the development of novel algorithms, this method is designed to reconstruct the evolutionary lineage of somatic haplotypes that define a tumor'$s$ clonal architecture; to robustly handle chromosome-scale LOH, ensuring contiguous and accurate phasing across complex genomic rearrangements; and to jointly estimate tumor purity, thereby deconvolving the mixed signals from tumor and normal cells to prevent phasing errors. By addressing these challenges within a unified model, this work seeks to provide a more precise and complete reconstruction of the cancer genome, enabling deeper insights into the evolutionary dynamics of tumorigenesis.
