*   **Title**: Joint Somatic Phasing and Purity Estimation Incorporating Loss of Heterozygosity in Tumor-Only Long-Read Sequencing
*   **Advisor**: Yao-Ting Huang
*   **Speaker**: Zhen-Yu Chen

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide introduces the topic of the master's thesis. The research focuses on developing a computational method for analyzing cancer genomics data. The key aspects of the work, as indicated by the title, are:

*   **Joint Somatic Phasing and Purity Estimation**: The method aims to simultaneously solve two problems:
    1.  **Somatic Phasing**: Determining which parental chromosome (haplotype) a somatic mutation occurs on.
    2.  **Purity Estimation**: Estimating the proportion of tumor cells within the sequenced sample, which is often a mix of tumor and normal cells.
*   **Incorporating Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)**: The method specifically uses information from LOH events—a common occurrence in cancer where a region of a chromosome loses one of its two alleles—to improve its estimations.
*   **Tumor-Only Long-Read Sequencing**: The methodology is designed for a specific and challenging data type: long-read sequencing data obtained only from a tumor sample, without a matched normal sample from the same patient. Long reads are particularly useful for phasing because they can span multiple variant sites.

### Introduction: Germline and Somatic Variants

This slide provides a foundational visual explanation of the distinction between germline and somatic genetic variants.

### Figure Description

The slide contains a central diagram that illustrates the origin, distribution, and inheritability of germline and somatic variants.

*   **Left Side (Inheritance):** The process begins with fertilization. A paternal sperm cell and a maternal egg cell, each containing their respective genetic material (chromosomes), are shown. A blue bar on a paternal chromosome represents a pre-existing genetic variant. These gametes combine to form an embryo, which inherits a complete set of chromosomes, including the paternal variant. This embryo develops into an adult human, with every cell containing this inherited (germline) variant.

*   **Right Side (Variant Types):** The diagram then branches to show two distinct types of variants present in the adult:
    *   **Germline variants:** These are the "Inherited mutations" that were present from conception. The diagram shows that these variants are present in the normal cells (represented by blue circles) of the individual. Because they are also present in the germ cells (e.g., sperm), they are labeled as "Inheritable" and can be passed on to the next generation.
    *   **Somatic variants:** These are "Novel mutations" that arise in specific body cells (somatic cells) during an individual's lifetime, often associated with factors like environmental exposure or errors in DNA replication. In the diagram, a new mutation (represented by an orange bar) appears in a subset of cells (orange circles), which could represent a tumor developing in a specific organ (indicated by a red dot on the person's torso). These variants are confined to the affected somatic cells and are not present in germ cells, making them "Uninheritable."

### Key Messages of the Visualization

*   **Germline variants** are inherited from parents, are present in virtually every cell of an individual's body from birth, and can be passed down to offspring.
*   **Somatic variants** are acquired after conception, are present only in a specific subset of cells (e.g., a tumor), and are not passed on to offspring.
*   This distinction is fundamental to cancer genetics, as cancer is driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations within a population of cells.

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide serves as an introduction to the core concepts of the thesis. By visually contrasting germline and somatic variants, it establishes the biological context necessary for the audience to understand the subsequent discussion on cancer genomics. The key takeaway is the different origin and fate of these two types of genetic alterations, which is a critical concept for methods that aim to distinguish them using sequencing data.

### Title
Related work: Phasing and Germline Variant Calling

### Figure Description

This slide presents two parallel workflows to illustrate the concepts of phasing and germline variant calling using long-read sequencing data. The top workflow depicts an idealized process, while the bottom workflow introduces the real-world challenge of sequencing errors and the use of modern computational models to address it.

**Top Workflow: Ideal Phasing Process**

This workflow outlines the conceptual steps for determining haplotypes (the sequence of variants on a single chromosome).

*   **1. Sample:** The process begins with a biological sample containing diploid cells, each with a pair of homologous chromosomes (one paternal, one maternal). These chromosomes contain different alleles at certain positions, known as heterozygous variants.
*   **2. Long-read Sequencing:** The DNA is sequenced, generating long reads. In this ideal scenario, the sequencing is perfect. The reads accurately capture segments of each chromosome, including the true variants (shown as dark blue boxes).
*   **3. Phasing:** The long reads are computationally grouped based on the variants they share. Because long reads often span multiple variant sites, they can be reliably assigned to their chromosome of origin. The diagram shows the reads being sorted into two distinct piles, one for each haplotype.
*   **4. Inferred Haplotypes:** The final output is two fully resolved haplotype sequences, one representing the paternal chromosome (e.g., A-G-G-C) and the other the maternal one (e.g., C-T-T-A).

**Bottom Workflow: Realistic Variant Calling with Error Correction**

This workflow illustrates a more practical approach that accounts for technological imperfections. A legend indicates that dark blue boxes are true variants, while yellow boxes represent sequencing errors.

*   **1. Long-read Sequencing:** As before, long reads are generated. However, these reads now contain not only true variants (blue) but also random sequencing errors (yellow). The challenge is to distinguish between these two.
*   **2. Phasing:** The reads are again phased into two groups corresponding to the original haplotypes. However, these groups are now "noisy," containing both true variants and random errors.
*   **3. Model Prediction:** The phased, noisy read alignments are fed into a sophisticated predictive model, represented by a neural network diagram. The slide names specific examples of such models: **DeepVariant** and **Clair3**. These deep learning models are trained to recognize the patterns of true variants versus the patterns of random sequencing errors.
*   **4. Germline Variant Calling:** The model outputs the final, high-confidence germline variant calls. It resolves the ambiguity between signal (variants) and noise (errors) to produce a clean, inferred genotype. The diagram shows the final two haplotypes with a focus on a heterozygous site, indicating the model has successfully identified the true genetic difference while filtering out the noise.

### Key Messages of the Visualizations

*   **Phasing is the process of separating sequencing reads according to their parental chromosome of origin to reconstruct haplotypes.** Long-read sequencing is particularly effective for this because a single long read can link multiple variants together.
*   **A major challenge in variant calling is differentiating true genetic variants from inevitable sequencing errors.** Simple consensus methods can be misled by these errors.
*   **Modern variant calling pipelines, such as DeepVariant and Clair3, use deep learning models to improve accuracy.** These models analyze the raw, phased read data to learn the signatures of true variants versus errors, leading to more reliable germline variant calls.

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide provides background on the state-of-the-art methods for germline variant calling. It first establishes the ideal goal of phasing—to perfectly reconstruct the two parental haplotypes. It then introduces the practical challenge posed by sequencing errors and highlights how modern tools like DeepVariant and Clair3 leverage deep learning to overcome this challenge. The key takeaway is that accurately calling germline variants from real-world sequencing data requires sophisticated computational models capable of distinguishing true biological variation from technological noise.

### Title
Related work: Somatic Variant Calling in Tumor-Normal Samples

### Figure Description

This slide presents a comprehensive workflow for identifying somatic mutations using long-read sequencing data from paired tumor and normal samples. A legend at the top left clarifies the color coding used throughout the diagram: orange boxes represent somatic variants, blue boxes represent germline variants, and yellow boxes represent sequencing errors.

The workflow is broken down into four main stages:

1.  **Long-read Sequencing:** The process begins with two biological samples from the same individual: a collection of **Tumor cells** and a collection of **Normal cells**. Both samples undergo long-read sequencing. The resulting reads from the tumor sample contain a mix of germline variants (blue), somatic variants (orange, which are unique to the tumor), and random sequencing errors (yellow). The reads from the normal sample contain only germline variants and sequencing errors.

2.  **Variant Calling:** This stage involves a joint analysis of reads from both the tumor and normal samples. By comparing the aligned reads against a reference genome (represented by the gray bar), the pipeline identifies positions where the DNA sequence differs. In the example shown, a germline variant (G/T) is present in both samples, while a potential somatic variant (G -> A) is observed only in the tumor reads. Sequencing errors (e.g., the yellow 'C') are also present in the read pileups.

3.  **Phasing:** The workflow then applies phasing specifically to the tumor reads. Phasing uses the linkage of variants along long reads to separate them into two groups, each corresponding to a parental chromosome (haplotype). This is a critical step because a somatic mutation typically occurs on only one of the two chromosomes. The diagram shows the tumor reads being successfully sorted: one haplotype group (top, green) contains the reference allele 'G', while the other haplotype group (bottom, light blue) contains the somatic allele 'A'. This separation concentrates the signal for the somatic variant and isolates it from the wild-type background, making it easier to distinguish from random noise. A sequencing error ('C') is also shown to be present in one of the phased groups.

4.  **Somatic Variant Calling:** The phased read information is then fed into a sophisticated model, represented by a neural network icon. This step aims to make the final, high-confidence call. The slide lists several state-of-the-art tools that employ this approach, including **DeepSomatic**, **ClairS**, and **Severus**. These models are trained to differentiate the patterns of true somatic variants from those of germline variants and random sequencing errors. In the final step, the model correctly identifies the 'A' as the true somatic variant while filtering out the sequencing error ('C', which is crossed out). The final output shows the confident identification of the somatic G-to-A mutation.

### Key Messages of the Visualizations

*   **Tumor-Normal Comparison is Essential:** Accurate somatic variant calling relies on comparing sequencing data from a patient's tumor tissue with data from their normal tissue to isolate mutations specific to the cancer.
*   **Phasing Enhances Somatic Signal:** By phasing the tumor reads, the signal from a low-frequency somatic variant can be concentrated onto a specific haplotype. This helps distinguish the true mutation from the background noise of sequencing errors, which are typically distributed randomly across both haplotypes.
*   **Machine Learning Improves Accuracy:** Modern somatic variant callers like DeepSomatic, ClairS, and Severus utilize machine learning models. These models analyze complex patterns in the phased read data to achieve higher accuracy, effectively discriminating between true somatic mutations and sequencing artifacts.

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide builds upon the previously discussed concepts of phasing and deep learning for variant calling, applying them to the more complex challenge of identifying somatic mutations. The key takeaway is that a robust somatic variant calling pipeline for long-read data involves a multi-step process: comparing tumor and normal samples, phasing the tumor reads to isolate the mutational signal, and using advanced machine learning models to make a final, accurate call. This sophisticated approach is necessary to overcome the challenges posed by sequencing errors and the often low frequency of somatic variants within a heterogeneous tumor sample.

### Title
Related work: Somatic Variant Calling in Tumor-Only Samples

### Figure Description

This slide illustrates a comprehensive workflow for identifying somatic mutations using long-read sequencing data from a **tumor-only sample**, which is a common scenario when a matched normal tissue sample is unavailable due to cost or accessibility. A legend at the top left clarifies the color coding: orange boxes represent somatic variants, blue boxes represent germline variants, and yellow boxes represent sequencing errors.

The workflow is presented in four distinct stages:

1.  **Long-read Sequencing & Filtering Source:** The process begins with **Tumor cells**, which contain a mixture of the individual's inherent germline variants (blue) and cancer-specific somatic variants (orange). These cells undergo long-read sequencing. In this workflow, the patient's **Normal cells** are unavailable (indicated by a cross-out). To compensate for the lack of a matched normal sample, a **Panel of Normals (PON)** is used. A PON is a database constructed from the sequencing data of a large cohort of healthy individuals, capturing common germline variants and recurrent sequencing artifacts.

2.  **Variant Calling:** Reads from the tumor sample are aligned to a reference genome. This initial calling step identifies all variants present in the tumor, including a germline variant (T, colored blue) and a potential somatic variant (A, colored orange). The variants identified in the tumor are then compared against the Panel of Normals. Any variant found in the PON is assumed to be a common germline polymorphism or an artifact and is filtered out. The diagram shows the germline 'T' variant being removed because it is present in the PON.

3.  **Phasing:** The remaining, filtered tumor reads undergo phasing. This process leverages the long-read information to separate the reads into groups corresponding to the two parental chromosomes (haplotypes). As a result, the true somatic variant ('A') is segregated onto one haplotype (light blue), effectively concentrating its signal. The reference allele ('G') is on the other haplotype (green). This step is crucial for distinguishing low-frequency somatic mutations from random sequencing errors (like the yellow 'C'), which tend to be distributed across both haplotypes.

4.  **Somatic Variant Calling:** The final stage uses a machine learning model, represented by a neural network diagram, to analyze the phased read data and make a definitive call. The slide lists several state-of-the-art tools adapted for this tumor-only approach: **DeepSomatic(TO)**, **ClairS-TO**, and **Severus(TO)**, where "(TO)" signifies "Tumor-Only". The model is trained to recognize the distinct signatures of true somatic variants in phased data, ultimately identifying the 'A' as the somatic mutation while correctly classifying the reference 'G' and filtering out noise.

### Key Messages of the Visualizations

*   **Panel of Normals (PON) Replaces Matched Normal:** The key innovation in the tumor-only workflow is the use of a Panel of Normals as a filter to remove common germline variants and artifacts, compensating for the absence of a patient-matched normal sample.
*   **Phasing Remains Essential for Signal Amplification:** Similar to the tumor-normal workflow, phasing the tumor's long reads is a critical step to separate haplotypes. This isolates the somatic variant's signal, making it easier to distinguish from the wild-type allele and random sequencing noise.
*   **Specialized Models for Tumor-Only Calling:** The task of calling somatic variants without a matched normal sample is more challenging and requires specialized tools. The listed callers (DeepSomatic(TO), ClairS-TO) are specifically designed or have modes dedicated to this purpose.

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide contrasts with the previously discussed tumor-normal workflow by presenting an alternative strategy for somatic variant calling when only a tumor sample is available. The central message is that the absence of a matched normal sample can be addressed by using a Panel of Normals (PON) to filter out non-somatic variants. The slide reinforces the importance of long-read phasing to enhance the signal of true mutations and highlights that specialized deep learning models are required to achieve high accuracy in this challenging tumor-only context.

### Title
Motivation: Lack of Somatic Phasing

### Figure Description

This slide presents the motivation for developing methods for somatic phasing by illustrating the concept of tumor evolution and its clinical implications. It is composed of two main visual sections.

**Figure 1: Clonal Evolution and the Phasing Challenge**

This figure, occupying the top half of the slide, explains the complexity of tumor genetics and the limitations of current phasing technologies.

*   **Clonal Evolution Diagram (Left):** This part illustrates how a tumor develops and becomes a heterogeneous mixture of different cell populations (subclones).
    *   The process starts with a **Founder mutation** (blue), which is a germline variant inherited from the parents and present in all of the individual's cells.
    *   A **Driver mutation** (yellow) then occurs somatically, initiating the cancer and creating the primary tumor clone (clonal).
    *   As the tumor grows, additional mutations occur, leading to the emergence of distinct **Subclones** (green and orange).
    *   The final tumor is depicted as a mass containing a mix of these cell populations, each with a unique combination of mutations.

*   **Haplotype Phasing Diagram (Right):** This part contrasts the established process of germline phasing with the challenge of somatic phasing.
    *   **Germline Haplotypes:** Current standard tools (e.g., WhatsHap, LongPhase, HapCut2) can successfully perform germline phasing. They analyze sequencing reads to separate them into two groups corresponding to the two parental chromosomes, or haplotypes (HP1 and HP2). An example DNA sequence shows HP1 and HP2 differing by a single germline variant (T vs. G, highlighted in blue).
    *   **Somatic Haplotypes:** This section, marked with a question mark, highlights the central problem. In a tumor, somatic mutations create new, cancer-specific haplotypes within each subclone. The diagram shows how the original germline haplotypes (HP1, HP2) can evolve into distinct somatic haplotypes like HP1-1, HP2-1, and HP2-1-1, each defined by the acquisition of new somatic mutations (highlighted in orange). The goal of somatic phasing is to reconstruct these specific subclonal haplotypes, a task that current tools cannot perform.

**Figure 2: Clinical Importance of Somatic Phasing in NSCLC**

This figure, in the bottom half of the slide, provides a concrete clinical example from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to demonstrate why somatic phasing is critical.

*   **Context:** The example focuses on mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene, specifically in Exons 20 and 21. A legend identifies two key mutations: L858R and T790M.
*   **Haplotype Configurations and Treatment:** The diagram shows two possible scenarios for a patient with both the L858R and T790M mutations:
    1.  **Trans Configuration:** The L858R mutation is on one haplotype (HP1-1), and the T790M mutation is on the other haplotype (HP2-1). In this case, the cancer is sensitive to either 1st or 3rd generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) like Gefitinib or Osimertinib.
    2.  **Cis Configuration:** Both the L858R and T790M mutations are on the same haplotype (HP2-1). This configuration confers resistance to 1st generation TKIs, and the patient must be treated with a 3rd generation TKI like Osimertinib.

### Key Messages of the Visualizations

*   **Tumors are Genetically Heterogeneous:** Cancers are not uniform masses but are composed of multiple subclones, each with a unique set of somatic mutations acquired during tumor evolution.
*   **Somatic Phasing is an Unsolved Problem:** While tools exist to determine an individual's two inherited (germline) haplotypes, there is a lack of methods capable of reconstructing the specific, newly-evolved somatic haplotypes present in different cancer subclones.
*   **Somatic Phase has Direct Clinical Consequences:** The arrangement of multiple somatic mutations on chromosomes (*cis* vs. *trans*) is not just an academic detail. As the EGFR example shows, it can determine a patient's sensitivity or resistance to specific targeted therapies, directly impacting treatment strategy and outcome.

### Summary of Key Messages

This slide argues that the lack of methods for "somatic phasing" is a significant gap in cancer genomics. It establishes that tumors are complex mixtures of subclones, each with unique genetic fingerprints. The central message is that determining the phase of somatic mutations—whether they occur on the same or different parental chromosomes—is clinically critical. Using NSCLC as a powerful example, the slide demonstrates that knowing the somatic haplotype configuration can directly guide the selection of the most effective targeted therapy, providing a strong motivation for developing new computational tools to solve this challenge.

### Title
Challenge 1: Chromosome-scale Loss of Heterozygosity

### Figure Description

This slide illustrates the first major challenge in somatic phasing: accurately identifying and phasing through large, chromosome-scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) events. It contrasts the output of existing bioinformatics tools with the desired, biologically correct result. The slide is divided into two main sections comparing phasing approaches and Copy Number Variation (CNV) detection.

**Figure 1: Comparison of Phasing Approaches in the Presence of LOH**

This figure, located in the upper half of the slide, visualizes how current phasing methods fall short when dealing with large-scale LOH and what the ideal output should look like.

*   **Source of the Problem (Left):** A diagram labeled "Tumor cells" shows a cell containing two parental chromosome homologs (one light blue, one dark blue). A large portion of the light blue chromosome is shown as lost, which represents a major LOH event where the tumor cell loses one of the two inherited copies of a chromosomal region.
*   **Existing Phasing Approaches (Top Right):** This diagram represents the output of current phasing tools. It shows sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome. Reads are colored to indicate their assigned haplotype (light blue for haplotype 1, dark blue for haplotype 2) or are left grey if unphased. The result is a set of fragmented haplotype "blocks." There are several distinct light blue and dark blue blocks, separated by large grey regions of unphased reads. This illustrates that existing methods fail to connect these blocks across the LOH region, breaking the chromosome into multiple, small, incorrectly phased segments.
*   **Expected Phasing (Bottom Right):** This diagram shows the ideal, correct phasing result. The dark blue haplotype is reconstructed as a single, continuous block spanning the entire region. The light blue haplotype is present only at the beginning and then disappears, correctly reflecting the large LOH event shown in the "Tumor cells" diagram. This demonstrates a contiguous, chromosome-scale phased haplotype.

**Figure 2: Comparison of LOH Detection by CNV Callers**

This figure, in the lower half of the slide, compares how existing CNV detection tools interpret LOH versus the actual underlying event.

*   **Existing Tool Output (Top Graph):** Associated with a list of standard CNV/SV callers (`CNVkit`, `ExomeDepth`, `Sniffles`, `Delly`), this graph plots copy number state against genomic loci. It shows both haplotypes (light and dark blue). The output depicts several separate, smaller regions labeled "LOH" where the light blue haplotype is lost. These are interspersed with regions where both haplotypes appear present. This output incorrectly suggests multiple independent LOH events.
*   **Expected Output (Bottom Graph):** This graph shows the true biological state. It depicts a single, continuous "LOH (Chromosomal-Scale)" event where the entire light blue haplotype is lost across a vast chromosomal region. This contrasts with the fragmented interpretation from existing tools.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Chromosome-scale LOH is a Major Challenge:** Large genomic deletions, common in cancer, lead to the loss of one parental chromosome copy over a wide area.
*   **Existing Tools Provide a Fragmented View:** Current phasing and CNV detection tools are not optimized for such large-scale events. They tend to break the analysis into smaller segments, misinterpreting a single, large LOH event as multiple, disconnected events or failing to phase across the region entirely.
*   **The Goal is Contiguous, Biologically Accurate Phasing:** The desired outcome is a method that can reconstruct complete, chromosome-scale haplotypes, correctly identifying the precise boundaries of large LOH events and maintaining phase consistency across the entire chromosome. This is a critical step for accurately understanding the genomic landscape of a tumor.

### Title
Challenge 2: Tumor Purity

### Figure Description

This slide addresses the second major challenge in somatic phasing: the impact of tumor purity. It illustrates how the proportion of tumor cells versus normal cells in a sequenced sample affects the accuracy of phasing and outlines a computational approach to estimate and correct for this mixture. The slide is divided into two main diagrams.

**Figure 1: The Effect of Tumor Purity on Haplotype Phasing**

This diagram, located in the upper half of the slide, contrasts the outcome of phasing in high-purity and low-purity tumor samples.

*   **High Purity Scenario:**
    *   **Input:** Shows a collection of sequencing reads. The majority of reads (indicated by an orange background and a male icon) originate from the tumor genome, while a smaller fraction (blue background, female icon) come from the contaminating normal genome. This represents a high-purity sample where the tumor signal is dominant.
    *   **Output (Phasing):** The phasing algorithm successfully separates the reads into two distinct and correct haplotypes. One haplotype (`A-T-C`) corresponds to the normal cells, and the other (`G-C-A`) corresponds to the tumor cells. The result is clean and accurate.

*   **Low Purity Scenario:**
    *   **Input:** Shows sequencing reads where the number of reads from the tumor genome (orange) and the normal genome (blue) are nearly equal. This represents a low-purity sample with significant normal cell contamination.
    *   **Output (Phasing):** The mixed signals from the tumor and normal cells confuse the phasing algorithm. It incorrectly links alleles from different haplotypes, resulting in a "switch error." For example, it incorrectly connects the `A` from the normal haplotype to the `A` from the tumor haplotype, and the `G` from the tumor to the `C` from the normal. This leads to an erroneous phased output.

**Figure 2: Workflow for Estimating Tumor Purity and Ploidy**

This diagram, in the lower half of the slide, illustrates a complete workflow for analyzing a mixed sample to determine its composition.

*   **Step 1: Initial Cell Populations:** The process begins with a conceptual mixture of "Tumor cells" and "Normal cells."
    *   **Tumor cells:** Depicted as being triploid (three copies of each chromosome shown), indicating a copy number aberration common in cancer.
    *   **Normal cells:** Depicted as being diploid (two copies of each chromosome), representing the healthy state.

*   **Step 2: Sample Sequencing:** The mixed cell population is sequenced (e.g., using "illumina" technology), generating a pool of short DNA reads. These reads originate from both the tumor and normal genomes.

*   **Step 3: Purity and Ploidy Estimation:** A bioinformatics tool, exemplified by "Ascat," analyzes the mixed sequencing reads to computationally separate the signals.
    *   The tool estimates key sample characteristics: **Purity = 0.5** (the sample is 50% tumor cells), **Tumor Ploidy = 3** (the average tumor cell is triploid), and **Normal Ploidy = 2** (the normal cells are diploid).
    *   Based on these estimations, the reads are computationally assigned to either the tumor component (orange box) or the normal component (blue box).

*   **Step 4: Reconstructed Genomes:** Using the estimated parameters, the tool reconstructs the distinct genomic profiles of the tumor and normal cell populations present in the original sample, reflecting the initial state. The value "0.5" is shown again, emphasizing the estimated purity.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Tumor Purity Critically Affects Phasing:** The accuracy of haplotype phasing is highly dependent on tumor purity. Low-purity samples, where normal cell DNA contamination is high, can introduce conflicting evidence that leads to significant phasing errors.
*   **Contamination Causes Phasing Errors:** When signals from normal and tumor haplotypes are present in similar proportions, phasing algorithms may incorrectly connect segments from different origins, creating biologically incorrect haplotypes.
*   **Purity and Ploidy Estimation is Essential:** To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to computationally estimate the tumor purity and ploidy from the mixed sequencing data. Tools like Ascat can perform this analysis.
*   **Computational Separation Enables Accurate Analysis:** By estimating purity and ploidy, it becomes possible to computationally deconvolute the mixed signals, allowing for a more accurate reconstruction of the separate tumor and normal haplotypes, which is a prerequisite for reliable downstream analyses.

### Title
Objective

### Figure Description

This slide presents a flowchart that outlines the objective of the master thesis: to develop and utilize a bioinformatics pipeline named **LongPhase-TO**. This pipeline is designed for the comprehensive analysis of "Tumor-Only" samples using data from long-read sequencing technologies.

The flowchart is organized from left to right, illustrating the entire workflow from the biological sample to the final computational outputs.

1.  **Input Sample and Sequencing:**
    *   The process starts with a **"Tumor-Only sample"**, which is depicted as a heterogeneous collection of cells. The different colors of the cells (yellow, orange, green) represent different tumor subclones or a mixture of tumor and normal cells. The chromosomes within these cells show different combinations of alleles (represented by blue and orange blocks), indicating genetic diversity.
    *   This sample undergoes **"Long-read Sequencing"**, which generates long DNA fragments (reads). Example reads are shown as sequences of nucleotides (A, T, C, G), with colored letters highlighting variant positions that differ between haplotypes.

2.  **The LongPhase-TO Pipeline:**
    The core of the slide is the "LongPhase-TO" pipeline, which processes the long-read data to perform three main tasks:

    *   **LOH Detection (Chromosomal-Scale):** This module is designed to identify large-scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) events. LOH is a genetic event common in cancer where a cell loses one of its two parental copies of a chromosome or a chromosomal region. The icon shows a pair of homologous chromosomes where a segment of one chromosome is lost, resulting in the presence of only one allele in that region.

    *   **Somatic Phasing:** This is a central function of the pipeline. Phasing is the process of assigning alleles to their specific parental chromosome of origin (haplotype).
        *   **Germline Haplotypes:** The pipeline first reconstructs the two fundamental **Germline Haplotypes** (labeled HP1 and HP2 and associated with male and female icons, representing the paternal and maternal inheritance). These represent the baseline genetic makeup of the individual before tumor development.
        *   **Somatic Haplotypes:** The pipeline then identifies **Somatic Haplotypes** (e.g., HP1-1, HP2-1, HP2-1-1), which have evolved from the germline haplotypes through the accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor progression. The arrows in the diagram illustrate this evolutionary lineage: a mutation on HP1 gives rise to HP1-1, and successive mutations on HP2 give rise to HP2-1 and then HP2-1-1. This provides a detailed, haplotype-resolved view of the tumor's evolution. The LOH event is shown to influence the presence and combination of these haplotypes in the tumor.

    *   **Purity Prediction:** This module aims to estimate the purity of the tumor sample (i.e., the proportion of cancer cells). The diagram shows the initial mixed cell population with one cell type crossed out, leading to a calculated **"Purity = 1"**. This suggests the pipeline can either work ideally with pure samples or can computationally determine that the sample consists entirely of tumor cells (even if clonally heterogeneous), effectively addressing the purity challenge mentioned in the previous context.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Main Goal:** The research objective is to develop "LongPhase-TO," an integrated pipeline for analyzing tumor-only samples using long-read sequencing.
*   **Comprehensive Cancer Genome Analysis:** LongPhase-TO combines three critical analyses in one workflow: chromosomal-scale LOH detection, high-resolution somatic phasing, and tumor purity prediction.
*   **Evolutionary Insight through Phasing:** A key focus is on somatic phasing to reconstruct the evolutionary history of tumor haplotypes, tracing the accumulation of mutations from the original germline state.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** The pipeline is designed for a "Tumor-Only" workflow, which is advantageous in clinical settings where a matched normal sample is often unavailable.
*   **Addressing Tumor Complexity:** The tool aims to tackle the complexities of tumor samples, such as clonal heterogeneity and purity, to provide a more accurate and detailed genomic characterization.

### Title
Method: Overview

### Figure Description

This slide provides a detailed, six-step overview of the bioinformatics method used in the thesis. The method is designed to analyze tumor-only samples using long-read sequencing data, starting from raw reads and culminating in a comprehensive genomic characterization including LOH, somatic haplotypes, and tumor purity.

**1. CNV/BFB Interval Calling**
This initial step involves analyzing the alignment of long sequencing reads to a reference genome. The diagram shows long reads (grey bars) with colored vertical lines indicating genetic variants. Dotted lines demarcate specific genomic intervals. Some reads are depicted with arrows, suggesting structural rearrangements like those found in Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) cycles. The key message is that the pipeline first screens the genome to identify regions potentially affected by large-scale Copy Number Variations (CNV) or complex rearrangements.

**2. Chromosomal-Scale LOH Detection**
This step focuses on identifying large regions of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). The visualization is a line graph where the y-axis represents the "Heterozygosity ratio" (from 0 to 1) and the x-axis represents a chromosomal region. The graph shows the ratio dropping from a high value (around 0.8) to a very low value (around 0.2) in a specific segment labeled "LOH." This illustrates how the method detects the loss of one parental chromosome copy by identifying a significant decrease in heterozygous variants across a large genomic scale.

**3. Somatic Variant Candidate Selection**
This is a critical filtering step to enrich for true somatic mutations. The diagram shows an initial pool of variants from the tumor sample (a circle containing blue, green, and orange dots). These variants are filtered by subtracting common germline variants found in a "Panel of Normals" (PON) database and applying other quality filters. The result is a refined set of high-confidence somatic variant candidates (two orange dots). This step is essential for reducing false positives in a tumor-only analysis where a matched normal sample is unavailable.

**4. Somatic Variant Calling**
This step identifies somatic mutations from the candidate list. The diagram displays aligned sequencing reads with a color code: grey for the reference allele, blue for the germline variant, orange for the somatic variant, and yellow for a sequencing error. It shows how the method distinguishes a true somatic variant, which is consistently present on multiple reads forming a new haplotype, from a random sequencing artifact. The small graph at the bottom illustrates this by showing the somatic variant (orange) creating a new, consistent path, while the sequencing artifact (yellow) is an isolated event.

**5. Phasing**
This is a central part of the methodology, where the pipeline reconstructs haplotypes. The diagram illustrates:
*   **Germline Haplotypes:** Two initial haplotypes, HP1 (A-G-T-C) and HP2 (G-G-T-G), are established.
*   **Somatic Haplotype Evolution:** A somatic mutation (T to G) occurs on HP1, giving rise to a new tumor-specific haplotype, HP1-1 (A-G-G-C).
*   **Read Assignment:** Sequenced reads are then assigned to their most likely haplotype of origin (HP1, HP2, or the somatic HP1-1).
*   **Integration with LOH:** The diagram differentiates between a "Non-LOH" region, where both germline haplotypes are present, and an "LOH" region, where one haplotype (HP1) is lost (indicated by the faded 'T'). This shows that the phasing process incorporates the LOH information from Step 2.

**6. Tumor Purity Prediction Equation**
The final step uses the phased haplotype information to estimate tumor purity. The visualization consists of:
*   **Cell Populations:** Icons at the top show cell mixtures with increasing proportions of tumor cells (orange) corresponding to increasing purity.
*   **Stacked Bar Chart:** The chart plots the relative abundance of the different haplotypes (HP1 - light blue, HP2 - dark blue, somatic HP1-1 - orange) against tumor purity values from 0.2 to 1. As purity increases, the proportion of the somatic haplotype (HP1-1) increases, while the proportion of the germline haplotype presumed to come from contaminating normal cells (HP2) decreases. The model (referred to as an "Equation") leverages these changing haplotype frequencies to calculate the purity of the tumor sample.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Integrated Workflow:** The slide presents a comprehensive, multi-step pipeline that integrates LOH detection, somatic variant calling, haplotype phasing, and tumor purity estimation into a single, cohesive method.
*   **Haplotype-Resolved Analysis:** A core strength of the method is its ability to perform phasing with long reads, allowing it to reconstruct not only the germline haplotypes but also the evolutionary new somatic haplotypes that drive cancer.
*   **Tumor-Only Design:** The methodology is specifically designed for tumor-only samples, using a Panel of Normals (PON) to effectively filter germline variants in the absence of a matched normal control.
*   **Leveraging Long Reads:** The entire process is built upon the strengths of long-read sequencing, which is crucial for accurate phasing of variants and detection of complex structural events.
*   **Quantitative Output:** The pipeline produces quantitative results, such as the location of LOH regions and a precise tumor purity estimate, which are derived from the relative frequencies of the phased haplotypes.

### Title
Method: Chromosomal-Scale LOH Detection

### Figure Description

This slide provides a detailed visual explanation of the method used for detecting Chromosomal-Scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) and associated structural variants. It expands on the LOH detection step introduced in the previous overview slide. The diagram is divided into three main conceptual parts: visualizing LOH using haplotype-specific reads, identifying structural variant signatures from read clipping patterns, and defining clipped reads using CIGAR strings.

**1. Haplotype-Based LOH Visualization**
The top half of the diagram illustrates the core concept of LOH detection.
*   **Initial State:** The uppermost panel shows a collection of aligned long sequencing reads (grey bars) with various colored vertical lines indicating heterozygous variants. In the middle, there is an increased pile-up of reads, hinting at a copy number change.
*   **Haplotype Separation and LOH:** The middle panel clarifies this by separating the reads into two putative haplotypes, represented by dark blue and light blue reads, respectively, and associated with two different individual icons (representing the two parental chromosome copies). A long horizontal arrow labeled "LOH (Chromosomal-Scale)" delineates a specific genomic region. Within this LOH region, the light blue reads (and their corresponding haplotype) are absent, while the dark blue reads continue. This visually represents the loss of one parental allele/haplotype, which is the definition of LOH.

**2. Clipping Pattern Analysis for Structural Variants**
The central graph plots the "Clipping count" (y-axis) against genomic position or "Loci" (x-axis). This graph analyzes the patterns of soft-clipped reads to infer the presence of specific structural variants (SVs) that are often mechanistically linked to LOH. A grey line represents the overall read "Coverage".
*   **Legend:** A blue upward arrow represents "Up clipping" (soft-clipping at the start of a read), and an orange downward arrow represents "Down clipping" (soft-clipping at the end of a read).
*   **CNV Signature:** The region labeled "CNV" (Copy Number Variation) shows a distinct pattern: a sharp peak of up-clipped reads followed immediately by a sharp peak of down-clipped reads. This signature is characteristic of a tandem duplication, where reads spanning the duplication breakpoint are clipped. The coverage is also shown to be elevated in this region.
*   **BFB Signature:** The region labeled "BFB" (Breakage-Fusion-Bridge) displays a more complex pattern of alternating and overlapping up- and down-clipping signals. This pattern suggests a fold-back inversion, a type of complex rearrangement that is a hallmark of BFB cycles.

**3. Definition of Clipped Reads and CIGAR Strings**
The bottom part of the slide provides a technical explanation of the clipping patterns shown in the graph above. It illustrates how read alignments are represented by CIGAR strings.
*   **Up-clipped read:** An example read is shown where the beginning of the read (sequence `GCT...`) does not align to the reference genome. Its CIGAR string is `10S 5M 2D 1M`, where `10S` signifies 10 soft-clipped bases at the start.
*   **Down-clipped read:** Another example shows a read where the end of the read (sequence `AGC...`) is soft-clipped. Its CIGAR string is `8M 10S`, with `10S` indicating 10 soft-clipped bases at the end.

This section connects the abstract clipping patterns in the graph to the concrete way sequence alignments are reported, demonstrating how these signatures are extracted from raw alignment data.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Multi-faceted LOH Detection:** The method detects LOH not just by observing the loss of heterozygous variants but by visualizing the complete loss of reads corresponding to one entire haplotype over a large chromosomal scale.
*   **SV Signatures from Clipping Patterns:** The analysis of soft-clipped read patterns provides powerful evidence for identifying the underlying structural variants (SVs) causing LOH, such as tandem duplications (CNV) and fold-back inversions (BFB).
*   **Leveraging Long-Read Data:** The entire approach relies on long sequencing reads, which are essential for both phasing haplotypes over long distances and for reliably spanning the breakpoints of structural variants to generate informative clipping signatures.
*   **Integrated Genomic Characterization:** The slide demonstrates an integrated approach where LOH detection is combined with SV analysis, allowing for a more comprehensive characterization of large-scale genomic aberrations in the tumor.

*Page 13*:
This slide provides a detailed, step-by-step illustration of the method used for "CNV/BFB Interval Calling." Following the previous slide's introduction to clipping patterns, this slide demonstrates the algorithm for formally identifying the genomic boundaries of these structural variants based on soft-clipping signatures in sequencing data.

### Title
Method : CNV/BFB Interval Calling

### Figure Description

The figure is a multi-panel diagram that visualizes the process of identifying genomic intervals containing Copy Number Variations (CNV) or Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) events by analyzing read clipping patterns.

1.  **Parsing Clipping (Top Panel):** This panel shows a schematic of long sequencing reads (grey arrow-shaped bars) aligned to a reference genome. The red segments at the ends of many reads represent soft-clipped portions—sequences that are present in the read but do not align to the reference at that location. The clipping is not random; the reads are organized into distinct pileups where clipping occurs at specific boundaries, forming patterns indicative of structural rearrangements.

2.  **Clipping Count (Middle Panel):** This panel quantifies the clipping data from the top panel into a scatter plot.
    *   The horizontal axis represents the genomic position.
    *   The vertical axis, labeled "Clipping Count," represents the number of clipped reads at each position. By convention, up-clipping (soft-clipping at the start of a read) is plotted as a positive count, while down-clipping (soft-clipping at the end of a read) is plotted as a negative count.
    *   Most of the plot shows low-level, scattered clipping events, likely representing alignment noise.
    *   However, two distinct regions show sharp, significant peaks. The first highlighted region (with an orange upward arrow) shows a strong peak of positive counts (up-clipping). The second highlighted region (with an orange downward arrow) shows a strong peak of negative counts (down-clipping). This signature of an up-clipping peak followed by a down-clipping peak is characteristic of a tandem duplication (a type of CNV), as shown in the previous slide.

3.  **Expected Interval / Small Region (Bottom Panel):** This panel illustrates the final output of the interval calling method. Based on the significant clipping signatures identified in the middle panel, the algorithm defines specific genomic regions.
    *   The thick black bars labeled "Interval" represent the regions that have been successfully "called" as likely containing a CNV or BFB event. The boundaries of these intervals correspond directly to the locations of the significant, opposing clipping peaks in the plot above.
    *   The slide also mentions "Small Region," suggesting a classification or filtering step might be applied, possibly based on the size of the interval or the strength of the clipping signal.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Algorithmic Interval Calling:** The slide details the computational method for moving from raw read alignment data (with clipping) to formally defined genomic intervals that contain structural variants like CNVs and BFBs.
*   **Quantitative Clipping Signatures:** The method works by quantifying soft-clipping patterns. It converts visual pileups of clipped reads into a numerical plot, allowing for the systematic detection of significant signatures (e.g., opposing peaks of up- and down-clipping).
*   **Defining SV Boundaries:** The core purpose of this method is to precisely identify the start and end points (the "interval") of a structural variant by locating the breakpoints where clipping signals accumulate.
*   **Operationalizing the Concept:** This slide provides the practical "how-to" for the conceptual framework introduced in the previous slide, showing how the theoretical clipping patterns of CNVs and BFBs are detected and delineated in practice.

### Title
Method : CNV/BFB Interval Calling (cont.)

### Figure Description

This slide presents a four-step flowchart detailing the computational method for identifying candidate locations for Copy Number Variation (CNV) or Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) events. Building on the previously introduced concept of clipping patterns, this slide illustrates the algorithm for processing raw clipping data to find significant signal peaks.

1.  **Parsing Clipping (Top Panel):** This panel visually represents sequencing reads (grey arrow-shaped bars) aligned to a reference genome. The red-colored ends of the reads signify "soft-clipped" portions—sequences present in the read but not aligning to the reference at that specific location. The visualization shows how these clipped reads can form distinct pileups at certain genomic positions, creating a pattern that suggests a potential structural rearrangement.

2.  **Clipping Count (Second Panel):** This panel translates the visual clipping information from the top panel into a quantitative scatter plot.
    *   The horizontal axis represents the genomic position.
    *   The vertical axis plots the "Clipping Count." By convention, one type of clipping (e.g., at the start of reads, or "up-clipping") is assigned a positive value (e.g., +1), while the opposite type (e.g., at the end of reads, or "down-clipping") is assigned a negative value (e.g., -1).
    *   Each point on the plot represents a specific genomic location where one or more reads are clipped. The y-value of the point indicates the net count and type of clipping at that position. This step converts the raw alignment data into a discrete numerical signal.

3.  **Forward Pileup (Third Panel):** This panel demonstrates a data smoothing technique applied to the "Clipping Count" signal.
    *   A line graph is generated by calculating a sliding window sum across the clipping counts. The slide provides an example where the window size `w` is 6.
    *   For each position, the algorithm sums the "Clipping Count" values of the `w` nearest points. This process, termed "Forward Pileup," transforms the sparse, spiky signal from the previous step into a continuous, smoothed profile. This smoothing helps to reduce noise and amplify regions with a consistent and strong clipping signal.

4.  **Find Peak (Bottom Panel):** In the final step, the algorithm analyzes the "Forward Pileup" profile to identify local maxima, or peaks.
    *   As indicated by the orange arrows and dotted circles, the peaks in the smoothed graph correspond to the locations with the most significant accumulation of a specific type of clipping.
    *   These peaks are identified as "Gentle Clipping Candidates," representing the most probable locations for the breakpoints of a CNV or BFB event.

### Equations

The slide provides two examples of the "Forward Pileup" calculation, which is a summation of clipping counts within a defined window `W` (here, with size `w=6`).

The first example shows a window with mixed positive and negative counts, resulting in a moderate pileup value. The second example shows a window where all counts are positive, leading to a strong peak in the pileup signal. *(Note: There appears to be a minor typo in the first calculation shown on the slide, as the sum `(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+1+(-1)+5` equals 0, not 2. However, the principle of summing values in a window remains clear).*

```markdown
(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+1+(-1)+5 = 2
```
```markdown
1+1+1+1+1+1=6
```

The key message of these equations is to demonstrate the mechanism of the sliding window sum. This mathematical operation is used to smooth the raw clipping count data, making it easier to programmatically identify significant signal peaks that might otherwise be obscured by noise.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Algorithmic Signal Processing:** The slide outlines a systematic, multi-step algorithm for processing raw soft-clipping data from DNA sequencing.
*   **From Raw Data to Candidate Sites:** The method follows a clear progression: 1) parsing visual clipping patterns, 2) quantifying them into a numerical signal, 3) smoothing the signal to enhance significant features using a sliding window sum ("Forward Pileup"), and 4) identifying peaks in the smoothed data as candidate breakpoints.
*   **Noise Reduction and Signal Enhancement:** A core component of the method is the "Forward Pileup" step, which effectively filters out random noise and amplifies consistent, localized clipping signals that are characteristic of structural variants.
*   **Automated Breakpoint Detection:** The ultimate goal of this method is to automate the detection of precise genomic locations ("Gentle Clipping Candidates") that are highly likely to be the boundaries of CNV or BFB events.

*Page 15*:
This slide continues the explanation of the "Method" for "CNV/BFB Interval Calling," building upon the signal processing steps detailed in the previous slide. It introduces two more sophisticated criteria for identifying significant clipping patterns: "Calling Gentle Clipping" and "Amplify Gentle Clipping."

### Visualizations

The slide presents two main sections, each containing one or more graphs to illustrate a specific signal processing step. The window size for these operations is specified as `w=6`.

**1. Calling Gentle Clipping**

This section describes a method for identifying regions with a consistent, albeit low-level, clipping signal.

*   **Figure Legend:** The top graph is a scatter plot where the y-axis represents the "Clipping Count" (positive for one clipping direction, negative for the other) and the x-axis represents the genomic position. Each point is a raw clipping count at a specific location. The graph highlights two scenarios:
    *   An 'X' marks a point that is likely rejected as it is an isolated signal.
    *   A checkmark ('✓') highlights a successful "call" where a dense cluster of points with the same sign (in this case, +1) are found within a window `w`. This indicates a sustained, or "gentle," clipping pattern rather than a single sharp peak.
*   **Key Message:** This step filters for candidate locations that are not necessarily high-amplitude peaks, but rather regions characterized by a high *density* of consistent, low-level clipping events. This is useful for identifying breakpoints that might not produce a strong, sharp peak but still have a clear, localized signal.

**2. Amplify Gentle Clipping**

This section describes a method for identifying breakpoints characterized by a rapid switch in the direction of clipping.

*   **Figure Legend:** This part consists of two linked graphs plotted against the same genomic position on the x-axis.
    *   The **top graph ("Clipping Pileup")** is a line chart showing the smoothed signal, which is the result of the "Forward Pileup" sliding window sum from the previous slide. It highlights a local minimum (valley) with a value of -8 and a subsequent local maximum (peak) with a value of -2.
    *   The **bottom graph ("Clipping Count")** is a scatter plot of the raw clipping counts that generated the pileup signal above. Arrows connect the dense clusters of raw counts to their corresponding smoothed values in the pileup graph: a cluster of negative counts corresponds to the -8 valley, and a subsequent cluster of positive counts corresponds to the -2 peak.
    *   The core concept is the rapid transition from a strong negative pileup to a positive one. The difference in their amplitudes is calculated to quantify this switch.
*   **Key Message:** This method is designed to detect a specific, powerful signature of a structural breakpoint: a sharp, localized transition from one type of clipping pileup (e.g., predominantly negative) to the opposite type (predominantly positive). The magnitude of this change, or "amplification," serves as a strong indicator of a high-confidence event.

### Equations

The slide presents a single equation to explain the "Amplify Gentle Clipping" concept.

This equation calculates the difference in amplitude between a local minimum (valley) and a subsequent local maximum (peak) in the "Clipping Pileup" graph. In the example provided, the calculation subtracts the pileup value of the valley (-8) from the value of the peak (-2) to find the total amplitude of the signal swing.

```markdown
-2 - (-8) = 6
```

The key message of the equation is to provide a quantitative score for the strength of a breakpoint signal that is characterized by a rapid switch in clipping patterns. A larger resulting value (in this case, 6) signifies a more pronounced and therefore more confident transition, effectively "amplifying" the signal of the gentle clipping events.

### Summary of Key Messages

*   **Advanced Signal Feature Detection:** The method moves beyond simple peak detection to employ more sophisticated criteria for identifying candidate CNV/BFB breakpoints.
*   **Two Types of Signatures:** The slide details two distinct signatures: "Gentle Clipping," which identifies regions with a high density of consistent clipping, and "Amplify Gentle Clipping," which identifies sharp transitions from one clipping direction to another.
*   **Quantifying Breakpoint Confidence:** The "Amplify" step introduces a quantitative metric (the amplitude of the pileup signal swing) to score the confidence of a candidate breakpoint. A larger amplitude indicates a stronger signal.
*   **Connecting Raw Data to Complex Signals:** The visualizations clearly link patterns in the raw, discrete clipping count data to more complex features (like valleys and peaks in close proximity) in the smoothed pileup signal, providing a clear rationale for the algorithm's logic.

*Page 16*:
Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : CNV/BFB Interval Calling (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

The slide contains three main visual components that illustrate the final steps of the interval calling method.

**1. Amplify Gentle Clipping Graph**

*   **Figure Legend:** This graph plots a processed signal against genomic position (implied x-axis). The y-axis represents the signal strength, ranging from -6 to 6. The plot shows a series of discrete signal points (grey dots) connected by lines. Two specific events are highlighted with dotted circles: a local maximum (peak) with a value of +4 and a local minimum (valley) with a value of -4. Arrows indicate that these prominent peaks and valleys are derived from clusters of smaller, raw signal events (small filled circles), effectively "amplifying" the signal from regions with dense, consistent clipping.
*   **Key Message:** This visualization illustrates how the method processes the raw clipping signal to identify significant local peaks and valleys. These amplified signal points serve as the primary candidates for defining the boundaries of structural variations.

**2. Interval Calling Graph**

*   **Figure Legend:** This is a simplified version of the signal plot above, designed to illustrate the "Signal Swing" concept. The y-axis ranges from -6 to 6. Two examples of signal swings are shown with orange arrows. The first swing connects a peak at +5 to a subsequent valley at -5 over a genomic distance of 7,000 base pairs (bp). The second swing connects a peak at +6 to a valley at -5 over a distance of 9,000 bp.
*   **Key Message:** This graph provides concrete examples of what the algorithm identifies as a "Signal Swing"—a pair of nearby, opposing peaks and valleys that meet specific criteria for amplitude and distance. These swings are considered strong evidence for a breakpoint.

**3. Result Schematic**

*   **Figure Legend:** This diagram shows the final output of the method in a format resembling a genome browser view. It consists of three layers:
    *   The top layer displays grey, arrow-shaped rectangles representing sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome. Reads with red, jagged ends likely represent soft-clipped reads, which are the source of the clipping signal.
    *   The middle layer, labeled "Interval," shows thick black vertical bars placed at the locations of the identified breakpoints.
    *   The bottom layer, labeled "Small Region," shows thick black horizontal bars that span the genomic regions between pairs of breakpoints, representing the final called intervals.
*   **Key Message:** This schematic demonstrates how the abstract signal processing and interval calling logic translate into a tangible genomic result. The identified signal swings are used to pinpoint precise breakpoint locations ("Interval") and define the boundaries of the affected genomic segments ("Small Region").

### **Equations**

The slide presents the formal criteria for "Interval Calling" using two conditions.

These equations define the rules for identifying significant genomic events. The first rule, "Event Burst," is a simple thresholding to identify any point of interest. The second, "Signal Swing," defines the core logic for pairing a peak and a valley to call a high-confidence event. It requires that the ratio of the signals at two points, `i` and `j`, exceeds a threshold `α`, and that the genomic distance between them is less than a threshold `β`. This formalizes the search for sharp, localized inversions in the clipping signal.

```markdown
Event Burst: c > λ

Signal Swing (i,j) ⇔ (c_j / c_i ≥ α) ∧ (|j - i| ≤ β)
```

The key message of these equations is to provide a quantitative and reproducible framework for identifying breakpoints. By defining a "Signal Swing" with both an amplitude condition (the ratio `α`) and a proximity condition (the distance `β`), the method can systematically filter for high-confidence events while ignoring random noise or distant, unrelated signals.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide concludes the description of the CNV/BFB interval calling method by detailing the final decision-making steps.

*   **Formal Criteria for Breakpoints:** The method uses a set of formal rules, defined by mathematical equations, to identify significant events called "Signal Swings."
*   **Signal Swings as Key Evidence:** A "Signal Swing," characterized by a rapid and localized transition between a signal peak and a signal valley, is the primary evidence used to call a breakpoint.
*   **Defining Genomic Intervals:** The identified breakpoints are used to define the start and end coordinates of the final CNV/BFB intervals.
*   **From Signal to Result:** The slide effectively connects the abstract signal processing concepts (peaks, valleys, swings) to the final, interpretable output: specific genomic regions identified as having structural variations, visualized in the context of the underlying sequencing read data.

*Page 17*:
Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : Chromosomal-Scale LOH Detection (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

The slide presents a multi-stage workflow for detecting large, chromosomal-scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) events, illustrating how smaller, localized events are handled to define the final region.

**1. Genomic Data and Initial Event Interpretation**

*   **Figure Legend:** This multi-layered diagram illustrates the process from raw data to event calling.
    *   **Top Layer (Sequencing Reads):** A schematic resembling a genome browser view shows sequencing reads (blue and light blue rectangles) aligned to a reference genome. Vertical colored lines within the reads likely represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
    *   **Annotation Layers ("Interval", "Small Region"):** Above the reads, annotations from a previous step (as per the context) mark out "Intervals" and smaller "Small Regions," which correspond to specific genomic events.
    *   **Middle Plot (Heterozygosity Ratio):** This plot shows the calculated heterozygosity ratio across the genomic region. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 1. The ratio is high (around 0.8) in some segments and drops to nearly zero in others. The high-ratio segments are marked with an orange 'X', suggesting they are distinct from the primary LOH regions.
    *   **Bottom Layer (Genomic Event):** This track provides an initial interpretation of the heterozygosity ratio plot. Regions where the ratio is near zero are labeled "LOH". The segments with a restored high heterozygosity ratio are labeled as "CNV" (Copy Number Variation) and "BFB" (Breakpoint-Fusion-Bridge), corresponding to the "Small Region" calls from the prior analysis step.
*   **Key Message:** This part of the diagram demonstrates how the heterozygosity ratio is used to make initial event calls. A low ratio is a clear signal for LOH. However, this initial pass reveals that large LOH regions can be interrupted by small, complex events like CNVs or BFBs, which temporarily restore or elevate the heterozygosity signal.

**2. Filtering and Merging Step**

*   **Figure Legend:** This lower part of the diagram, introduced by a large grey arrow, illustrates the final processing step, explicitly labeled "Skipping small CNV/BFB events".
    *   The initial `LOH - CNV - BFB - LOH` event sequence is shown. Dashed arrows indicate that the algorithm "skips" over the intervening CNV and BFB events, effectively merging the flanking LOH segments.
    *   The final resulting plot shows a single, continuous block of low heterozygosity ratio, which is now classified as one large "LOH" event.
*   **Key Message:** The core logic of chromosomal-scale detection is to merge adjacent LOH segments by filtering out small, intervening events (CNV, BFB). This allows the method to identify the true, large-scale LOH that might be characteristic of major chromosomal alterations, rather than a collection of smaller, fragmented events.

### **Equations**

The slide includes two mathematical expressions that define the core metrics for LOH detection.

The first equation defines how the heterozygosity ratio is calculated from sequencing read counts. It is the proportion of reads that support a heterozygous allele out of all reads covering a variant site. The second expression is the decision rule for calling an LOH event: it occurs when this calculated ratio falls below a predefined threshold, `σ`.

```markdown
Heterozygosity ratio = Het Count / (Het Count + Hom Count)
```

```markdown
Heterozygosity ratio < σ
```

The key message of these equations is to formalize the LOH calling process. The ratio provides a quantitative measure of allelic balance, and the threshold `σ` provides a clear, reproducible criterion for distinguishing LOH regions from normal heterozygous regions.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details the final stage of a genomic analysis pipeline focused on identifying large-scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH).

*   **LOH is Detected via Heterozygosity Ratio:** The primary signal for LOH is a significant drop in the heterozygosity ratio, calculated from SNV data in sequencing reads, to a value near zero.
*   **Small Events Can Interrupt LOH Regions:** The method recognizes that complex events like Copy Number Variations (CNV) and Breakpoint-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) cycles can occur within larger LOH regions, causing localized spikes in the heterozygosity signal.
*   **Merging for Chromosomal-Scale Detection:** To identify the full extent of chromosomal-scale events, the algorithm includes a crucial filtering step that "skips" or ignores these small intervening CNV/BFB events, merging the flanking LOH segments into a single, contiguous call.
*   **From Complex Signals to a Coherent Result:** The overall workflow refines a complex signal pattern (dips and spikes in heterozygosity) into a simple, biologically meaningful interpretation: the presence of a large, chromosomal-scale LOH event.

Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Candidate Selection

### **Visualizations**

This slide outlines a three-step method for genomic analysis, with a primary focus on the third step: selecting somatic variant candidates. Steps 1 and 2, which identify large-scale structural changes, provide the context for the fine-grained variant selection in step 3.

**1. Overall Methodological Flow (Left Panel)**

*   **Figure Legend:** The panel on the left illustrates a three-stage bioinformatics pipeline.
    1.  **CNV/BFB Interval Calling:** The first step involves identifying intervals of Copy Number Variation (CNV) or Breakpoint-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) events from sequencing read data.
    2.  **Chromosomal-Scale LOH Detection:** The second step, building on the previous analysis, detects large regions of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) by analyzing the heterozygosity ratio across the genome. A low ratio indicates LOH.
    3.  **Somatic Variant Candidate Selection:** The third and main step detailed on this slide is the selection and filtering of somatic (tumor-specific) single nucleotide variants.
*   **Key Message:** The overall method first characterizes the large-scale genomic landscape (CNVs, LOH) and then zooms in to perform a detailed and rigorous selection of small-scale somatic mutations.

**2. Somatic Variant Filtering Workflow (Right Panel)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This diagram provides a detailed walkthrough of the variant filtering process. It uses a color-coded legend for different allele types: Reference (grey), Germline (blue), Somatic (brown), and Non-Somatic (yellow).
    *   **Somatic Variant Candidate:** The top line represents the initial list of variants called by tools like ClairS-TO or DeepSomatic from sequencing reads. This raw list is a mixture of true somatic mutations (brown), germline variants (blue), and other non-somatic or ambiguous calls (yellow).
    *   **Panel of Normals Variant:** The middle step shows the filtering process. The initial candidates are compared against a "Panel of Normals" (PON), a database of variants commonly found in a population of healthy individuals (e.g., from 1000g, gnomAD) and recurrent artifacts. The diagram shows that the germline variants (blue) from the initial list are found in this panel.
    *   **Filtered Somatic Candidate:** The bottom line shows the result of the filtering. By removing variants present in the PON, the list is refined to primarily contain high-confidence somatic candidates (brown) and other rare variants not found in the normal population.
*   **Key Message:** Raw variant calls from sequencing data are noisy and contain many non-somatic variants. To obtain a reliable list of true somatic mutations, it is essential to filter the initial candidates against a Panel of Normals to eliminate common germline polymorphisms and known sequencing artifacts.

**3. Conceptual Filtering Model (Bottom Left)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This is a simplified schematic that visually represents the logic of "Somatic Variant Candidate Selection" (Step 3). It begins with a circle containing a heterogeneous population of detected variants: somatic (brown), germline (blue), and clustered/artifact (green). The model shows that two components are subtracted: the "PON" (Panel of Normals) to remove germline variants, and "Clustered" variants to remove likely systematic errors. The final output is a circle containing only the filtered, high-confidence somatic variants (brown).
*   **Key Message:** The strategy for identifying true somatic mutations is one of subtraction. By systematically removing known germline variants (using a PON) and technical artifacts (identified by their clustered patterns), one can isolate the true, biologically relevant somatic mutations.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide describes the third step in a comprehensive genomic analysis pipeline, focusing on the rigorous filtering required to identify true somatic variants.

*   **Contextual Analysis:** The selection of somatic variants occurs after the characterization of large-scale events like CNV, BFB, and LOH.
*   **Filtering is Crucial:** The core of the method is a multi-stage filtering process designed to distinguish true somatic mutations from germline variants and technical artifacts.
*   **Use of Panel of Normals (PON):** A key tool in this process is the Panel of Normals, a database of common variants and artifacts, which is used to subtract non-somatic calls from the initial candidate list.
*   **Artifact Removal:** In addition to the PON, the method also filters out clustered variants, which are often a sign of systematic sequencing errors.
*   **High-Confidence Output:** The goal of this meticulous process is to generate a high-confidence list of somatic variant candidates for downstream biological interpretation and research.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Candidate Selection (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

This slide continues the explanation of the somatic variant selection method, focusing on a specific filtering step designed to remove clustered variants, which are often technical artifacts from the sequencing process.

**1. Allele Type Legend and Initial State (Top)**

*   **Figure Legend:** A legend at the top left defines the color coding for different types of alleles observed in sequencing reads: Reference (grey), Germline (blue), Somatic (brown), and Non-Somatic/Artifact (yellow). To the right, a diagram illustrates a set of aligned sequencing reads (Read 1-6) at a specific genomic location `i` and its surrounding window `W`. These reads contain a mix of reference bases, a true somatic variant candidate (C), and a non-somatic variant (T), which is part of a cluster of potential errors. The line labeled "Somatic Variant Candidate" represents the initial output from a variant caller, which includes both the true somatic variant and the artifact that needs to be filtered.
*   **Key Message:** Raw variant calls can contain true somatic mutations alongside artifacts. This slide details the method for distinguishing between them by identifying and removing variants that appear in suspicious clusters.

**2. Allele Concordance Filtering Workflow (Main Diagram)**

*   **Figure Legend:** The main diagram illustrates the core logic of the filtering process through four example scenarios. The goal is to evaluate a candidate variant at position `i` (the yellow 'T') by checking its "Allele Concordance" with other nearby variants at a position `j`. A high degree of concordance—meaning two variants consistently appear together on the same reads—suggests they may be part of a systematic sequencing error rather than independent biological events.
    *   The workflow evaluates pairs of variants (`i`, `j`) using two concordance metrics (explained in the Equations section).
    *   Each of the four panels represents a test between the candidate variant `i` and a different nearby variant `j`.
    *   A test for a pair `(i,j)` is considered successful (passed, indicated by a circle) if the calculated ratios meet predefined thresholds (`μ` and `ν`).
    *   **Panels 1 & 3** show pairs that pass the concordance test (indicated by circles and a final checkmark). In panel 3, the variants at `i` and `j` are perfectly concordant (ratio = 1), meaning every read with a variant at `i` also has a variant at `j`, and vice-versa.
    *   **Panels 2 & 4** show pairs that fail the test (indicated by a cross). In panel 2, the concordance is low (0.33). In panel 4, the concordance is asymmetric (one ratio is 1, the other is 0.5), causing it to fail.
    *   The final step aggregates these pairwise concordance results. If the overall "Allele Concordance" score for variant `i` exceeds a threshold `ρ`, it is classified as a "Filtered Clustered Variant" and removed.
*   **Key Message:** Variants are not evaluated in isolation. By analyzing the co-occurrence patterns of nearby variants on the same sequencing reads, the method can identify and filter out artifacts that appear in clusters. High allele concordance between a candidate variant and its neighbors is a strong indicator of a false positive.

### **Equations**

The slide presents two equations that define the metrics for calculating "Allele Concordance" between a variant at position `i` and a variant at position `j` based on reads that span both locations.

The equations are used to measure how often an alternate (non-reference) allele at position `i` co-occurs with an alternate allele at position `j` on the same sequencing read. A high value for both metrics indicates strong linkage, suggesting a potential systematic artifact.

*   The first equation calculates the fraction of reads with an alternate allele at `i` that also have an alternate allele at `j`.
*   The second equation calculates the fraction of reads with an alternate allele at `j` that also have an alternate allele at `i`.

For a pair of variants to be considered concordant, both fractions must be above their respective thresholds, `μ` and `ν`.

The final filtering rule checks if the overall "Allele Concordance" score, which is an aggregate of these pairwise checks for a variant `i`, exceeds a final threshold `ρ`.

```markdown
(AltAlt_ij) / (AltAlt_ij + AltRef_ij) ≥ μ
```

```markdown
(AltAlt_ij) / (AltAlt_ij + RefAlt_ij) ≥ ν
```

Where:
*   `AltAlt_ij`: Number of reads with an alternate allele at both `i` and `j`.
*   `AltRef_ij`: Number of reads with an alternate allele at `i` and the reference allele at `j`.
*   `RefAlt_ij`: Number of reads with the reference allele at `i` and an alternate allele at `j`.
*   `μ`, `ν`: Pre-defined concordance thresholds.

```markdown
Filtered Clustered Variant(i) = Allele Concordance ≥ ρ
```

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details a crucial filtering step in the somatic variant calling pipeline, building upon the methods introduced in the previous slide.

*   **Continuation of Method:** It explains the "Clustered Variant" filtering that was mentioned as part of the overall "Somatic Variant Candidate Selection" method.
*   **Targeted Problem:** The focus is on eliminating false positive variants that arise from systematic sequencing artifacts, which often manifest as clusters of co-occurring errors.
*   **Core Mechanism:** The method employs a quantitative measure called "Allele Concordance" to identify variants that are suspiciously linked on the same sequencing reads.
*   **Quantitative Filtering:** By calculating concordance ratios and comparing them against set thresholds (`μ`, `ν`, and `ρ`), the process systematically identifies and removes candidate variants that are likely artifacts.
*   **Increased Specificity:** The ultimate goal of this step is to increase the confidence and accuracy of the final somatic variant call set by removing a known class of false positives.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Calling

### **Visualizations**

This slide introduces a graph-based methodology for somatic variant calling, designed to accurately distinguish true somatic mutations from sequencing artifacts by analyzing local haplotype information.

**1. Allele Legend (Top Left)**

*   **Figure Legend:** A legend defines the color-coding used throughout the slide for different types of genetic alleles:
    *   **Grey:** Reference Allele (the base present in the reference genome).
    *   **Blue:** Germline Variant (an inherited variant present in all cells).
    *   **Brown:** Somatic Variant (a mutation acquired by a subset of cells, e.g., in a tumor).
    *   **Yellow:** Sequencing Error (an artifact introduced during the sequencing process).
*   **Key Message:** This legend is crucial for interpreting the subsequent diagrams, which use these colors to differentiate the origin of each observed allele.

**2. Tumor Evolution Diagram (Left)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This diagram illustrates the biological basis of tumor heterogeneity and the origin of different variant types. It traces cellular lineage from a zygote (formed by an egg and sperm) to a complex organism with a tumor. The diagram shows:
    1.  **Origin:** Initial cells inherit a germline variant (blue stripe on the chromosome).
    2.  **Clonal Evolution:** As cells divide, new mutations arise. "Clonal 2" acquires a somatic variant (brown stripe). "Subclone 1.1" branches off, acquiring an additional somatic mutation (orange stripe).
*   **Key Message:** This illustrates that a single tissue sample can contain a mixture of cells with different genetic profiles (germline, clonal somatic, and subclonal somatic variants), making it challenging to identify true somatic mutations.

**3. Somatic Variant vs. Sequencing Artifact (Center)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This central panel contrasts two scenarios using simplified sequencing read alignments and their corresponding graph representations.
    *   **Read Alignments:** It shows how sequencing reads might look for a true "Somatic Variant" versus a "Sequencing Artifact". Both occur in the context of a pre-existing germline variant. In the "Somatic Variant" case, some reads contain a true somatic mutation (brown 'T'). In the "Sequencing Artifact" case, some reads contain a sequencing error (yellow 'T'). Visually, the raw data can appear similar.
    *   **Simple Graphs:** Below the reads, a simple directed graph shows the linkage between adjacent bases on a read. For example, `A -> G -> T` might represent the reference haplotype, while `C -> T -> A` represents a haplotype containing a germline variant (`C`), a somatic variant (`T`), and another germline variant (`A`).
*   **Key Message:** The primary challenge in somatic variant calling is distinguishing rare, true variants from sequencing errors, especially when they co-occur with other variants on the same reads. This section sets up the problem that the proposed graph method aims to solve.

**4. Tri-nodal-edge Graph (Top Right)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This diagram introduces the proposed "Tri-nodal-edge Graph". The graph models haplotypes across three adjacent genomic positions.
    *   **Nodes:** The nodes represent the allele type at each of the three positions, either Reference (R) or Alternate (A).
    *   **Edges:** The edges represent the observed combinations of alleles across the three positions (i.e., the 3-base haplotypes). The edges are labeled with codes like `rrr` (Reference-Reference-Reference), `rra` (Reference-Reference-Alternate), `aar` (Alternate-Alternate-Reference), etc. Different colors and line styles for the edges correspond to these different haplotype patterns.
*   **Key Message:** This graph structure is proposed as a powerful way to model the local context of a variant. By considering the linkage information across three positions simultaneously, it captures more information than simpler models, which helps in disambiguating complex cases.

**5. Bi-nodal-edge Graph (Bottom Right)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This diagram shows a simpler, alternative graph structure labeled "noninformative".
    *   **Nodes & Edges:** This graph models haplotypes across only two adjacent positions. The nodes are again Reference (R) or Alternate (A), and the edges represent the four possible two-base haplotypes: `rr`, `ra`, `ar`, and `aa`.
*   **Key Message:** This graph is presented as an inferior alternative. By labeling it "noninformative," the slide argues that considering variants in pairs (bi-nodal) is insufficient to resolve the ambiguity between true somatic variants and artifacts. This highlights the necessity of the more complex "Tri-nodal-edge Graph" for accurate variant calling.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide introduces a novel method for somatic variant calling that addresses the challenge of distinguishing true mutations from sequencing artifacts within a heterogeneous cell population.

*   **Problem:** Somatic variants are often rare and can co-occur with germline variants and sequencing errors, making them difficult to identify reliably.
*   **Proposed Solution:** A "Tri-nodal-edge Graph" is proposed to model the local haplotype context of a candidate variant by analyzing allele combinations across three adjacent positions.
*   **Core Claim:** The method's strength lies in its ability to capture rich linkage information. The slide explicitly contrasts this approach with a simpler "Bi-nodal-edge Graph" (looking at pairs of variants), which it dismisses as "noninformative" for this task.
*   **Overall Goal:** The proposed graph-based method aims to improve the accuracy of somatic variant calling by leveraging more comprehensive local sequence context than conventional approaches.

*Page 21*:
Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Calling (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

This slide continues the explanation of the tri-nodal-edge graph method for somatic variant calling, detailing how different combinations of observed haplotypes are classified. The visualization uses a color code where blue nodes represent a germline alternate allele and orange nodes represent a somatic alternate allele.

**1. Haplotype Input Scenarios (Left)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This section illustrates two hypothetical scenarios based on the number of distinct haplotypes present in a sample.
    *   **"3 haplotype" scenario:** A sample contains reads from three distinct chromosome types: two with a germline variant (represented by two grey figures and chromosomes with a blue bar) and one with an additional somatic variant (represented by an orange figure and a chromosome with both a blue and an orange bar). This complex mixture provides rich information.
    *   **"2 haplotype" scenario:** A simpler sample contains reads from only two distinct chromosome types.
*   **Key Message:** The number of distinct haplotypes observed in the data determines the confidence of the variant call. A more complex mixture (3 haplotypes) allows for higher confidence classification.

**2. Somatic Haplotype Pattern Catalog (Top Right)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This large grid visualizes the specific local haplotype patterns that the model identifies as high-confidence somatic variants. It shows the possible paths through the tri-nodal graph (representing three adjacent variant positions). The nodes are either Reference (R) or Alternate (A), with alternate alleles colored blue for germline and orange for somatic. The grid is categorized by the position of the somatic mutation:
    *   **Middle Somatic:** The somatic variant (orange 'A') is at the central position, flanked by other variants.
    *   **Left Somatic:** The somatic variant is at the first position.
    *   **Right Somatic:** The somatic variant is at the third position.
    In total, 12 distinct patterns are shown that serve as the signature for a high-confidence somatic call.
*   **Key Message:** The method relies on a predefined catalog of 12 specific tri-haplotype patterns. If the combination of haplotypes observed in the sequencing reads matches one of these 12 patterns, the variant is classified as a high-confidence somatic mutation.

**3. Low-Confidence and Non-Somatic Patterns (Bottom Right)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This section illustrates the classification for patterns that do not meet the high-confidence criteria.
    *   A set of simpler graph patterns, derived from the "2 haplotype" scenario, is shown. These lead to a low-confidence call.
    *   A concluding statement, "Not matching any somatic pattern → V_N(NonSomatic)", indicates that any combination of haplotypes not fitting the defined high- or low-confidence patterns is classified as non-somatic.
*   **Key Message:** Haplotype combinations that provide less definitive evidence are classified as low-confidence. All other combinations are rejected as non-somatic, making the method specific.

### **Equations**

The slide presents two formulas that quantify the feature space for classifying variants based on combinations of observed haplotypes. The model appears to work by identifying which set of the 8 possible tri-nodal edge types (e.g., `rrr`, `rra`, etc., from the previous slide) are present in the data.

1.  **High-Confidence Somatic Variant (V_H)**: This equation corresponds to the "3 haplotype" scenario. It represents the classification of a high-confidence somatic variant. The model is looking for combinations of 3 distinct haplotypes from the 8 possibilities. The denominator `C(8,3)` represents the total number of ways to choose 3 distinct haplotype patterns from a set of 8, which is 56. The numerator `12` represents the number of these specific combinations that are defined as high-confidence somatic patterns (as shown in the visual catalog).

    ```markdown
    V_H(High) ∈ (12 / C(8,3)) = 12 / 56
    ```

2.  **Low-Confidence Somatic Variant (V_L)**: This equation corresponds to the "2 haplotype" scenario. It represents a low-confidence call. The model is looking for combinations of 2 distinct haplotypes. The denominator `C(8,2)` is the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct haplotype patterns from 8, which is 28. The numerator `3` is the number of these combinations that are defined as low-confidence patterns.

    ```markdown
    V_L(Low) ∈ (3 / C(8,2)) = 3 / 28
    ```

*   **Key Message of Equations:** The classification is not based on a single haplotype but on identifying specific *combinations* of co-occurring haplotypes. The formulas define the size of the feature space for high- and low-confidence calls, showing that the method relies on combinatorial pattern matching.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide elaborates on the classification logic of the tri-nodal-edge graph method, building on the concepts from the previous slide.

*   **Core Mechanism:** The method classifies a variant by matching the set of observed local haplotypes against a predefined catalog of patterns.
*   **Confidence Levels:** The confidence of a call depends on the complexity of the observed haplotype combination.
    *   **High-Confidence (V_H):** A call is made when the data matches one of 12 specific patterns involving three distinct haplotypes, providing strong evidence for a somatic mutation.
    *   **Low-Confidence (V_L):** A call is made for simpler patterns involving only two distinct haplotypes.
    *   **Non-Somatic (V_N):** Any pattern not matching the high- or low-confidence criteria is rejected.
*   **Combinatorial Approach:** The strength of the method lies in its use of combinatorial haplotype patterns, allowing it to distinguish true somatic variants from complex germline backgrounds and artifacts with high specificity.

Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Calling (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

This slide details the filtering and artifact removal steps of the somatic variant calling method, building upon the pattern-matching concepts from the previous slide. The method is divided into two distinct workflows for high-confidence (V_H) and low-confidence (V_L) variant calls. In the diagrams, blue nodes represent germline alternate alleles and orange nodes represent somatic alternate alleles.

The slide illustrates a two-step process for each confidence level:
1.  **Frequency Filtering:** Selecting the most frequent local haplotypes (patterns of alleles across adjacent variant sites) from the sequencing reads.
2.  **Pattern Artifact Filtering:** Applying a ratio-based filter using read counts to eliminate patterns that are likely to be sequencing artifacts, thus increasing the specificity of the calls.

---

#### **V_H Pattern Mining and Filtering (Top Half)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This section describes the workflow for identifying high-confidence somatic variants (V_H), which are derived from a "3 haplotype" scenario.
    *   **Frequency Filtering (Select Top 3):** The process begins by analyzing the aligned sequencing reads covering the variant region. It identifies all unique local haplotypes and their corresponding read counts. In the example shown, the three most frequent haplotypes are `A-C-T` (3 reads), `G-C-G` (2 reads), and `G-T-G` (2 reads). These top 3 are selected for further analysis.
    *   **Pattern Matching:** The selected set of three haplotypes is then matched against the predefined catalog of high-confidence `V_H` patterns. The example shows that the combination {`A-C-T`, `G-C-G`, `G-T-G`} corresponds to a valid `V_H` graph structure.
    *   **Pattern Artifact Filtering:** This is a crucial step to improve accuracy. A candidate `V_H` pattern is tested to ensure it is not an artifact. The diagram illustrates a scenario where a pattern is rejected. It calculates an "Artifact path ratio." In the example, a path with low support (`A-C-T`, count 1) is compared to a path with higher support (`G-T-G`, count 2). The ratio of their read counts is calculated. If this ratio exceeds a predefined threshold `τ`, the pattern is considered an artifact and reclassified as non-somatic (`V_N`). The condition for a valid `V_H` call is that this ratio must be less than or equal to `τ`.
*   **Key Message:** A high-confidence somatic variant is called only if the top three most frequent haplotypes match a specific `V_H` pattern *and* pass a stringent artifact filter. This filter ensures that minor, potentially erroneous, haplotypes do not have significant read support compared to the primary somatic haplotype.

---

#### **V_L Pattern Mining and Filtering (Bottom Half)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This section describes the parallel workflow for identifying low-confidence somatic variants (V_L), which are derived from a simpler "2 haplotype" scenario.
    *   **Frequency Filtering (Select Top 2):** In this case, only the top two most frequent haplotypes are selected. The example shows `G-C-G` (2 reads) and `G-T-G` (2 reads) being chosen.
    *   **Pattern Matching:** This pair of haplotypes is matched against the predefined `V_L` patterns. The example pair {`G-C-G`, `G-T-G`} corresponds to a valid `V_L` graph structure.
    *   **Pattern Artifact Filtering:** A different artifact filter is applied for `V_L` calls. It checks if a third, less frequent haplotype exists with significant support. The filter calculates the ratio of the read count of the 3rd most frequent path to the 2nd most frequent path. For a `V_L` call to be valid, this ratio must be below a threshold `δ`. If the ratio is too high (as in the example, where the 3rd path has a count of 1 and the 2nd has a count of 2, leading to a ratio of 1/2), it suggests the site might be more complex (e.g., a `V_H` pattern) or noisy, and the `V_L` call is rejected.
*   **Key Message:** A low-confidence call is made when the top two haplotypes fit a `V_L` pattern, but only if there isn't a third haplotype with significant read support. This filter prevents misclassifying more complex variant sites as simple `V_L` cases.

### **Equations**

The slide presents the logic for the artifact filtering steps as inequalities involving read count ratios and predefined thresholds.

1.  **V_H Artifact Filter Condition:** For a candidate pattern to be confirmed as high-confidence (`V_H`), its artifact path ratio must be less than or equal to a threshold `τ`. The example on the slide shows a case where the pattern is *rejected* because the ratio is too high. Note: There appears to be a typo in the slide's calculation `1/(1+2)`; a more standard ratio of the two path counts would be `1/2`.

    ```markdown
    Artifact path ratio <= τ
    ```
    *Example of rejection:*
    ```markdown
    Ratio = Count(Artifact Path) / Count(Somatic Path) = 1 / 2
    If (1/2 > τ), then the pattern is rejected (classified as V_N).
    ```

2.  **V_L Artifact Filter Condition:** For a candidate pattern to be confirmed as low-confidence (`V_L`), the ratio of the read count of the 3rd most frequent haplotype path to that of the 2nd most frequent path must be less than a threshold `δ`. The example shows a rejection.

    ```markdown
    (Top 3 path / Top 2 path) < δ
    ```
    *Example of rejection:*
    ```markdown
    Ratio = Count(Top 3 path) / Count(Top 2 path) = 1 / 2
    If (1/2 > δ), then the pattern is rejected (classified as V_N).
    ```

*   **Key Message of Equations:** The method's specificity relies on quantitative filters. These filters use ratios of read counts to distinguish true, well-supported haplotype patterns from those likely caused by sequencing artifacts or more complex underlying biology. Different thresholds (`τ` and `δ`) are used for high and low-confidence calls, reflecting their different evidentiary standards.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details the crucial filtering steps that refine the initial pattern-matching approach to somatic variant calling.

*   **Hierarchical Filtering:** The method first identifies candidate variant patterns by selecting the most frequent haplotypes (`Top 3` for `V_H`, `Top 2` for `V_L`).
*   **Ratio-Based Artifact Removal:** It then applies a second, more stringent filtering stage based on read count ratios to reject patterns that are likely artifacts.
*   **Context-Specific Filters:** The artifact filtering logic is tailored to the confidence level:
    *   For `V_H` calls, it ensures that sub-paths within the complex 3-haplotype pattern are well-balanced and not skewed by a single noisy path.
    *   For `V_L` calls, it ensures that the site is truly simple (2-haplotype) and not a misidentified complex site by checking the prevalence of a potential third haplotype.
*   **Increased Specificity:** This two-stage process of pattern mining followed by artifact filtering is designed to significantly increase the precision and reliability of the final somatic variant calls.

### **Title**
Method : Somatic Variant Calling (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

This slide illustrates the final decision-making stage of the somatic variant calling method, which follows the haplotype pattern mining and filtering described on the previous slide. The core idea is to classify identified local haplotype patterns into different evidence categories and then use a "voting" system to make a final call.

The overall workflow shown is:
1.  **Input Reads to Graph:** Sequencing reads covering a genomic region are used to construct a graph representing the different haplotypes (paths) present.
2.  **Pattern Classification ("Somatic Decision Vote"):** Each unique local haplotype pattern derived from the graph is classified into one of three categories:
    *   **3-path pattern ∈ V_H(High):** A high-confidence somatic pattern. This complex pattern likely represents the presence of a reference allele, a germline variant allele, and a somatic variant allele, forming three distinct paths. The orange node signifies the somatic allele.
    *   **2-path pattern ∈ V_L(Low):** A low-confidence somatic pattern. This simpler pattern typically represents a reference allele and a single somatic variant allele.
    *   **Neither 3-path nor 2-path pattern ∈ V_N(NonSomatic):** Any pattern not fitting the high or low confidence criteria is classified as non-somatic.
3.  **Tally and Decision:** The counts of V_H, V_L, and V_N patterns are tallied for the site, and a final decision is made using a quantitative formula.

---

#### **Pattern Classification Examples**

The slide presents two contrasting examples to demonstrate the classification process. In the diagrams, orange nodes represent somatic alternate alleles, and blue nodes represent germline alternate alleles.

*   **Figure Legend (Middle Column - "Somatic Variant"):** This column depicts a scenario where a site is correctly identified as containing a somatic variant. It shows a catalog of different haplotype patterns found at this site. These patterns are individually classified, resulting in a final tally of **V_H = 1, V_L = 1, and V_N = 3**. The key feature is the presence of one high-confidence (`V_H`) pattern, which provides strong evidence for a somatic mutation.

*   **Figure Legend (Right Column - "Germline Variant"):** This column illustrates a non-somatic site, likely containing only germline variants or sequencing noise. After classifying all observed patterns, the tally is **V_H = 0, V_L = 1, and V_N = 5**. The absence of any `V_H` patterns and the low proportion of `V_L` patterns suggest that this site does not harbor a somatic variant.

*   **Key Message:** The method's strength lies in its ability to differentiate complex, high-confidence somatic patterns (`V_H`) from simpler or ambiguous ones. A final decision is not based on a single piece of evidence but on an aggregate vote from all patterns observed at a locus, with `V_H` patterns carrying the most weight.

### **Equations**

The slide provides the final "Somatic Variant Detection Formula," which formalizes the voting process into a clear decision rule.

The formula states that a site is called a somatic variant if either of two conditions is met:
1.  There is at least one high-confidence pattern (`V_H ≥ 1`).
2.  The proportion of low-confidence patterns relative to all non-high-confidence patterns is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold `θ`.

```markdown
V_H ≥ 1  or  (V_L / (V_L + V_N)) ≥ θ
```

The slide includes calculations for the two examples:
*   **Somatic Variant Example:** With `V_H = 1`, `V_L = 1`, and `V_N = 3`, the first condition `V_H ≥ 1` is met. The site is called somatic, regardless of the ratio calculation (`1 / (1+3) = 0.25`).
*   **Germline Variant Example:** With `V_H = 0`, `V_L = 1`, and `V_N = 5`, the first condition is not met. The decision depends on the second condition. The ratio is calculated as `1 / (1+5) = 0.167`. The slide indicates `0.167 < θ`, meaning the ratio is below the required threshold, so the site is correctly classified as non-somatic.

*   **Key Message of Equations:** This two-tiered formula provides a robust framework for variant calling. It ensures high sensitivity by immediately calling any site with strong (`V_H`) evidence. Simultaneously, it maintains specificity by requiring an accumulation of weaker (`V_L`) evidence to pass a statistical threshold `θ`, effectively filtering out noise.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide describes the final classification and decision-making step of the somatic variant calling method.

*   **Pattern-Based Voting:** The method classifies local haplotype patterns into high-confidence somatic (`V_H`), low-confidence somatic (`V_L`), and non-somatic (`V_N`) categories.
*   **Hierarchical Decision Rule:** A final call is made using a two-part formula. A site is considered somatic if it contains at least one `V_H` pattern OR if the proportion of `V_L` patterns is statistically significant (i.e., above a threshold `θ`).
*   **Robustness and Specificity:** This approach combines evidence from all observed patterns at a site, making the final call more robust than methods that consider variants in isolation. The distinction between `V_H` and `V_L` evidence and the use of the threshold `θ` allow for a tunable balance between sensitivity and specificity.

### **Title**
Method : Phasing

### **Visualizations**

This slide provides a detailed visual explanation of the "Phasing" step, which is a core component of the variant calling method. Phasing is the process of assigning alleles from different variant sites to their original chromosomes (haplotypes). This slide demonstrates how sequencing read data is used to construct haplotypes, including identifying a new somatic haplotype. The process flows from left to right, starting with input data and ending with the final phased haplotypes.

The overall workflow consists of four main stages:

1.  **Parsing Info (Input Data):** This section shows the input data as a set of aligned sequencing reads covering several variant positions. The region is divided into a "Non-LOH" (Non-Loss of Heterozygosity) part, where two distinct parental alleles are present, and an "LOH" part, where one of the parental alleles has been lost. The different colors (light blue, dark blue, orange) represent alleles belonging to different haplotypes.

2.  **k-variant Graph (Data Structure):** The information from the reads is used to build a "k-variant Graph." In this example, `k=2`, meaning the graph models the linkage between adjacent pairs of variants.
    *   **Nodes:** Each node in the graph represents a specific allele (e.g., 'A', 'G', 'T', 'C') at a variant position. The colors correspond to the likely haplotype of origin: black/light blue for Haplotype 1 (HP1), dark blue for Haplotype 2 (HP2), and orange for a somatic variant.
    *   **Edges:** A directed edge between two nodes indicates that the two connected alleles were observed together on the same sequencing read.
    *   **Edge Weights:** The number on each edge represents the number of reads supporting that specific connection (co-occurrence). For example, the edge from 'G' to 'C' has a weight of '3', indicating strong evidence for this linkage.

3.  **Phasing (Algorithm):** This section illustrates the step-by-step process of traversing the k-variant graph to reconstruct the full haplotypes. The algorithm starts with the most common alleles at the first position to seed the main haplotypes (HP1 starting with 'A', HP2 with 'G'). It then extends these paths one variant at a time, following the edges with the strongest support (highest weight). When a split occurs, like from 'G' to 'C' (3 reads) and 'T' (1 read), the main haplotype (HP2) follows the stronger path to 'C', while the weaker path to 'T' suggests a lower-frequency variant, likely somatic. This process is repeated across all variant sites.

4.  **Phasing Result and Final Result (Output):** The final output of the phasing process is a set of reconstructed haplotypes.
    *   **HP1 (light blue/black):** A germline haplotype (`A-T-G-T...`).
    *   **HP2 (dark blue):** A second germline haplotype (`G-C-G-A...`).
    *   **HP2-1 (orange):** A somatic haplotype (`G-C-T-A...`). This haplotype is shown to be derived from HP2 but contains a somatic mutation ('T' instead of 'G' at the third position) and another mutation ('T' instead of 'A' at the last position in the LOH region).
    *   The "Result" section provides a simplified, column-wise view of the phased alleles at each position, clearly distinguishing the alleles belonging to HP1, HP2, and the somatic HP2-1. The LOH region is handled by showing the lost alleles as faded nodes in the "Phasing Result."

*   **Key Message of Visualizations:** The core message is that by representing allele co-occurrence in a weighted `k-variant Graph`, it is possible to algorithmically reconstruct the underlying haplotypes from sequencing data. This method is powerful enough to distinguish between two primary germline haplotypes (HP1, HP2) and simultaneously identify and phase a new, low-frequency somatic haplotype (HP2-1). This provides the detailed haplotype information needed for the subsequent pattern classification and variant calling steps.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide explains the "Phasing" methodology, which is the foundational step for generating the haplotype patterns used in the subsequent variant calling decision process.

*   **Graph-Based Reconstruction:** The method leverages a `k-variant graph` to model connections between alleles found on the same sequencing reads.
*   **Haplotype Identification:** By finding the most supported paths through this graph, the algorithm reconstructs the two main germline haplotypes (HP1 and HP2).
*   **Somatic Haplotype Discovery:** The method is sensitive enough to identify less frequent paths, allowing it to discover and reconstruct novel somatic haplotypes (HP2-1) that differ from the germline haplotypes.
*   **Foundation for Variant Calling:** The output of this phasing process—a clear separation of alleles into distinct haplotypes—is the essential input for the pattern classification and "voting" system described on the following slide for making a final somatic call.

### **Title**
Method : Tumor Purity Prediction Equation

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a comprehensive workflow for predicting tumor purity from sequencing data by analyzing Haplotype Imbalance (HI). The workflow progresses from the biological sample composition to the final machine learning-based prediction.

1.  **Sample Composition and Haplotype Ratios (Top Row):**
    *   The process starts by illustrating the cellular composition of a sample, which is a mixture of "Normal cells" and "Tumor cells."
    *   Normal cells contain two germline haplotypes, HP1 (light blue) and HP2 (dark blue).
    *   Tumor cells contain a somatic alteration, resulting in a new haplotype, HP1-1 (orange), which is derived from the original HP1.
    *   A series of five scenarios is shown, representing increasing tumor purity (the fraction of tumor cells in the sample) from 0.2 to 1.0 (20% to 100%).
    *   Stacked bar graphs next to each purity level depict the expected proportion of each haplotype in the mixed sample's sequencing data. As purity increases, the contribution from the normal HP1 decreases while the somatic HP1-1 increases, causing a measurable imbalance between the total counts of reads derived from the original HP1 and HP2 haplotypes.

2.  **Haplotype Imbalance (HI) Distributions (Middle Row):**
    *   For each purity level, a histogram shows the distribution of Haplotype Imbalance (HI) values calculated across many heterozygous variant sites in the genome.
    *   The x-axis of the histograms represents the HI value (from 0.5 to 1), and the y-axis represents the "Variant Count."
    *   At low purity (0.2), the HI distribution is concentrated near 0.5, indicating that the two germline haplotypes are relatively balanced.
    *   As tumor purity increases, the distribution shifts to the right, with more variants showing higher HI values. In high-purity samples (e.g., 0.8, 1.0), a prominent peak appears at HI = 1, corresponding to regions with Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) where one of the germline haplotypes is completely lost in the tumor cells.

3.  **Box Plot Summaries of HI Distributions (Third Row):**
    *   Directly below each histogram, a corresponding box plot summarizes its distribution. The box plot shows the median (orange line), interquartile range (Q1 to Q3, the box), and whiskers.
    *   These plots clearly show that as tumor purity increases, the median HI and the entire distribution shift towards higher values.

4.  **Polynomial Regression Model for Purity Prediction (Bottom Row):**
    *   This section illustrates the machine learning approach. Statistical features, such as the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles, are extracted from the box plots of the HI distribution.
    *   These features are then used as input for a "Polynomial Regression" model, symbolized by a neural network icon.
    *   The model is trained to learn the relationship between the HI distribution statistics and the known tumor purity.
    *   The final output of the model is a predicted "purity" value, represented on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

*   **Key Message of Visualizations:** The central message is that tumor purity creates a quantifiable signature in the genome-wide distribution of Haplotype Imbalance. By summarizing this distribution with statistical features (like quartiles) and feeding them into a regression model, it is possible to accurately predict the purity of a given tumor sample.

### **Equations**

The slide defines the metric used to measure allelic imbalance at each variant site: Haplotype Imbalance (HI). The equation calculates the proportion of sequencing reads that support the more abundant of the two germline haplotypes (HP1 or HP2) at a given heterozygous locus. An HI value of 0.5 signifies a perfect 1:1 balance, while a value of 1.0 indicates that only one of the two haplotypes is present in the sequencing reads for that site, a sign of LOH.

```markdown
HI = max(HP1, HP2) / (HP1 + HP2)
```

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details a method for predicting tumor purity by leveraging the phased haplotype information described on the previous slide.

*   **Haplotype Imbalance as a Biomarker:** The core idea is that the presence of tumor cells with somatic alterations (like LOH or other copy number changes) creates an imbalance in the observed germline haplotypes. This Haplotype Imbalance (HI) is a direct, measurable biomarker of tumor content.
*   **Purity-Dependent Distribution:** The statistical distribution of HI values across all heterozygous sites in the genome changes predictably with tumor purity. Higher purity leads to a higher average HI.
*   **Machine Learning for Prediction:** A polynomial regression model can be trained to learn the precise relationship between the statistical properties of the HI distribution (e.g., quartiles) and the actual tumor purity.
*   **Automated Purity Estimation:** This method provides a data-driven, automated way to estimate tumor purity, a critical parameter for accurately interpreting somatic variants and understanding tumor biology.

Here is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Method : Tumor Purity Prediction Equation (cont.)

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a schematic workflow detailing how two genomic features, Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Ratio and Haplotype Imbalance, are used as inputs for a polynomial regression model to predict tumor purity.

1.  **Sample Composition and Feature Variation (Top and Middle Rows):**
    *   The workflow begins by illustrating samples with varying "purity" levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0), representing the fraction of tumor cells mixed with normal cells. Tumor cells are shown with a clear LOH event (one chromosome homolog is lost, represented by the orange color).
    *   Below each purity level, two corresponding features are shown:
        *   **LOH Ratio:** This is the fraction of the genome exhibiting LOH. For low-purity samples (0.2-0.8), this signal is weak and quantified as "<5%". For a pure tumor sample (purity=1.0), the signal is strong at "35%".
        *   **Haplotype Imbalance:** A box plot summarizes the distribution of Haplotype Imbalance (HI) values across the genome. As purity increases from left to right, the median and interquartile range of the box plots shift to higher values, indicating a stronger and more widespread imbalance.

2.  **Machine Learning Model for Purity Prediction (Right Side):**
    *   The diagram illustrates that features are extracted from a given sample. Specifically, the calculated "LOH Ratio" and statistical summaries of the "Haplotype Imbalance" distribution (represented by the box plot, with the first and third quartiles, Q1 and Q3, highlighted) are used as inputs.
    *   These features are fed into a "Polynomial Regression" model, which is visually represented by a multi-layer neural network icon.
    *   The model processes these input features to produce a single output: a predicted "purity" value on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. This output is visualized with a color gradient bar, where blue corresponds to low purity and orange corresponds to high purity.

*   **Key Message of Visualizations:** The central message is that tumor purity can be predicted by a machine learning model. The model learns the relationship between tumor purity and two key genomic features: the proportion of the genome affected by LOH and the statistical distribution of Haplotype Imbalance. As purity increases, both features change in a predictable manner, allowing for accurate regression-based prediction.

### **Equations**

The slide defines the LOH Ratio, which quantifies the extent of Loss of Heterozygosity across the entire genome. The equation states that the LOH Ratio is the total length of genomic regions with LOH (`L_LOH`) divided by the total analyzable length of the genome (`L_Genome`). This ratio serves as one of the primary input features for the purity prediction model.

```markdown
LOH Ratio = L_LOH / L_Genome
```

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide continues the description of the tumor purity prediction method, moving from the conceptual basis of Haplotype Imbalance (from the previous slide) to its application in a quantitative model.

*   **Feature Engineering:** The method relies on extracting two key features from genomic data: the LOH Ratio (the fraction of the genome with LOH) and statistics from the Haplotype Imbalance distribution (such as quartiles Q1 and Q3).
*   **Predictive Modeling:** A polynomial regression model is employed to map the values of these features to a precise, continuous prediction of tumor purity.
*   **Feature-Purity Correlation:** The slide visually demonstrates the core principle that both the LOH Ratio and the Haplotype Imbalance distribution are strongly correlated with tumor purity, making them effective predictors.
*   **Integrated Approach:** The method integrates information about large-scale copy number changes (LOH Ratio) and more subtle allelic imbalances (Haplotype Imbalance) to create a robust and accurate purity estimation tool.

### **Title**
Data : Sources and Tools Used in This Study

### **Tables**

The slide features two tables that list the data sources and software tools used in the research.

The first table, on the left, details the cell lines and their corresponding data sources. It has three columns: "Cell Line," "Material Source," and "Benchmark Source." This table specifies six different cancer cell lines used in the study (COLO829, H1437, H2009, HCC1395, HCC1937, HCC1954). For each cell line, it lists the institution that provided the raw sequencing data (Material Source), such as ONT, NYGC, and UCSF. It also identifies the source of the ground-truth or benchmark variant calls (Benchmark Source), which include NYGC, Google, and SEQC2.

*   **Key Message of the Table:** The study is built upon a foundation of well-established and publicly available cancer cell line data from multiple reputable consortia and institutions. This ensures the data is of high quality and that the results can be independently verified.

```markdown
| Cell Line | Material Source | Benchmark Source |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| COLO829   | ONT, NYGC       | NYGC             |
| H1437     | UCSC            | Google           |
| H2009     | UCSC            | Google           |
| HCC1395   | HKU, NYGC       | SEQC2            |
| HCC1937   | UCSC            | Google           |
| HCC1954   | UCSC            | Google           |
```

The second table, on the top right, lists the specific somatic variant calling tools employed in the analysis. It includes three distinct software configurations: ClairS-TO v0.3.0 (ssrs), ClairS-TO v0.3.0 (ss), and DeepSomatic v1.8.0 (tumor-only).

*   **Key Message of the Table:** The study utilizes and likely compares multiple state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools for identifying somatic mutations, including different modes of ClairS-TO and the tumor-only mode of DeepSomatic.

```markdown
| Somatic Variant Callers           |
|-----------------------------------|
| ClairS-TO v0.3.0 (ssrs)             |
| ClairS-TO v0.3.0 (ss)               |
| DeepSomatic v1.8.0 (tumor-only)   |
```

### **Visualizations**

The diagram at the bottom right illustrates the methodology for creating synthetic, or *in-silico*, tumor-normal mixture samples. This process is often called *in-silico* titration.

*   **Workflow:** The diagram shows that sequencing reads from a pure "Tumor" sample and a pure "Normal" sample are combined in varying proportions to simulate different levels of tumor purity.
*   **Purity Levels and Coverage:** Five specific mixture examples are provided, corresponding to purity levels of 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2. The diagram explicitly shows the sequencing coverage contributed by the tumor (orange boxes) and normal (blue boxes) components for each mixture. For example, to create a sample with 0.8 purity, 40x coverage from the tumor sample is mixed with 10x coverage from the normal sample, resulting in a total coverage of 50x. At 1.0 purity, the sample is composed entirely of 50x tumor data with 0x normal data.
*   **Purpose:** This method creates a benchmark dataset where the tumor purity of each sample is precisely known. This is essential for training and validating the accuracy of the purity prediction model described in the previous slide.

*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The study employs a controlled, synthetic approach to generate benchmark data. By mixing pure tumor and normal sequencing data at predefined ratios, the researchers can create a reliable dataset with known ground-truth purity values, which is critical for evaluating the performance of their method and other tools.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide provides a comprehensive overview of the data and computational framework for the thesis, establishing the foundation for the methods and results that follow.

*   **Data Foundation:** The research utilizes multiple, well-characterized public cancer cell line datasets, enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of the findings.
*   **Tooling:** A selection of modern somatic variant calling tools is used, suggesting a comparative analysis or a multi-tool approach to ensure robust variant detection.
*   **Benchmark Generation:** The core methodological contribution highlighted is the use of *in-silico* titration to create synthetic datasets with precisely controlled tumor purity levels. This provides an essential ground truth for training and validating the tumor purity prediction model that was the focus of the preceding slide.

### **Title**
Result : LOH Detection

### **Visualizations**

The slide presents two bar charts, labeled (a) and (b), comparing the performance of three different computational pipelines for Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) detection across eight different cancer cell line samples. The pipelines are differentiated by the somatic variant caller used as input for a tool named `LongPhase-TO`. The three pipelines are:
1.  `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` (light teal)
2.  `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)` (light purple)
3.  `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` (dark blue)

The x-axis of both charts lists the cancer cell line samples, such as COLO829, H1437, H2009, etc., which were introduced in the previous slide.

**Figure (a): LOH Ratio**

*   **Figure Legend:** This bar chart compares the total LOH ratio detected by the three different pipelines for each sample. The y-axis represents the "LOH Ratio," which is the proportion of the genome identified as having lost heterozygosity, with a scale from 0.0 to 0.8. Each group of bars corresponds to a specific cancer cell line sample.
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The chart shows that the `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` and `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)` pipelines detect a consistently higher LOH ratio across most samples compared to the `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` pipeline. The LOH ratios vary significantly between cell lines, with HCC1395 and HCC1937 showing the highest ratios (around 0.5), and HCC1954 showing the lowest (around 0.1). This suggests that the choice of the underlying variant caller significantly impacts the quantity of LOH regions detected.

**Figure (b): Largest Block (MB)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This bar chart compares the size of the largest contiguous phased block (in Megabases, MB) identified by each of the three pipelines. The y-axis, "Largest Block (MB)," scales from 0 to 160. This metric is an indicator of the phasing contiguity, which is crucial for identifying long-range LOH events.
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** Similar to the LOH ratio, the `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` and `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)` pipelines consistently produce larger phased blocks than the `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` pipeline. For example, in the COLO829 samples, the former two methods identify a largest block of approximately 110 MB, while the latter identifies one around 100 MB. This indicates that the `ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO` variant callers provide better input for `LongPhase-TO`, enabling the detection of longer, more contiguous LOH regions.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide presents results comparing three computational pipelines for LOH detection, building upon the tools and data introduced previously. The key takeaways are:

*   **Performance Comparison:** The pipelines using `ClairS-TO-ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO` as inputs for `LongPhase-TO` outperform the pipeline using `ClairS-TO-ss`.
*   **Quantitative and Qualitative Superiority:** This outperformance is demonstrated both quantitatively (higher total LOH ratio detected) and qualitatively (longer contiguous LOH blocks identified).
*   **Methodological Implication:** The results strongly suggest that the choice of somatic variant caller is a critical factor for accurate and comprehensive LOH detection when using the `LongPhase-TO` tool. The `ssrs` mode of ClairS-TO and the tumor-only mode of DeepSomatic appear to be better suited for this application than the `ss` mode of ClairS-TO.

### **Title**
Result : Comparison of Germline and Somatic Phasing

### **Visualizations**

The slide presents two bar charts, labeled (a) and (b), that compare the performance of four different phasing pipelines across eight cancer cell line datasets. The pipelines are differentiated by the phasing tool used (`LongPhase` for germline vs. `LongPhase-TO` for somatic) and the mode of the variant caller (`ClairS-TO-ssrs` vs. `ClairS-TO-ss`) that provides the input variants.

The four pipelines compared are:
1.  `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` (light teal): A somatic-specific phaser.
2.  `LongPhase(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` (green): A standard germline phaser using the same input as #1.
3.  `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` (light blue): A somatic-specific phaser with a different input variant set.
4.  `LongPhase(ClairS-TO-ss)` (dark blue): A standard germline phaser using the same input as #3.

The x-axis of both charts lists the different cancer cell line samples, such as COLO829_NYGC, H1437_UCSC, etc.

**Figure (a): Phased Ratio**

*   **Figure Legend:** This bar chart illustrates the "Phased Ratio," which represents the proportion of heterozygous variants that were successfully phased (assigned to a specific parental chromosome). The y-axis scales from 0.0 to 1.0. A higher ratio indicates more complete phasing.
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The chart demonstrates that the somatic-specific phaser, `LongPhase-TO` (light teal and light blue bars), consistently achieves a higher phased ratio (around 0.5-0.6) across all samples compared to its germline counterpart, `LongPhase` (green and dark blue bars). The performance of the germline phaser is lower and more variable, indicating that the somatic-aware model is more effective at phasing variants identified in tumor samples.

**Figure (b): Block N50 (bp)**

*   **Figure Legend:** This bar chart compares the contiguity of phasing using the "Block N50" metric, measured in base pairs (bp). The y-axis scales up to 30 million bp (3e7). Block N50 is a standard measure where 50% of the total phased length is contained in blocks of this size or larger. A higher Block N50 value signifies longer, more contiguous phased blocks.
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** This chart shows a dramatic performance difference. The `LongPhase-TO` pipelines produce significantly larger Block N50 values (often between 10-25 million bp) than the `LongPhase` pipelines, for which the Block N50 is consistently very low (typically under 1 million bp). This result strongly suggests that `LongPhase-TO` is far superior at reconstructing long, continuous haplotypes from tumor sequencing data, which is essential for analyzing large-scale genomic events like LOH.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide provides a crucial comparison justifying the choice of a somatic-specific phasing tool for analyzing tumor data. The key findings are:

*   **Somatic Phasing Superiority:** The `LongPhase-TO` tool, designed specifically for somatic variant phasing, significantly outperforms the standard `LongPhase` (germline) tool when applied to tumor-only data.
*   **Improved Completeness and Contiguity:** This superiority is evident in two key metrics: `LongPhase-TO` achieves a higher Phased Ratio (more variants are phased) and a dramatically higher Block N50 (the resulting phased blocks are much longer and more contiguous).
*   **Methodological Justification:** The results validate the use of `LongPhase-TO` for downstream analyses like Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) detection, as long-range phase information is critical for accurately identifying large regions of allelic loss. The performance of `LongPhase-TO` makes it a suitable foundation for the LOH detection results shown on the previous slide.

### **Title**
Result : LOH Detection (HCC1395_HKU)

### **Visualizations**

The slide presents a series of 24 plots, each corresponding to a human chromosome (chr1-22, chrX, and chrY) for the HCC1395_HKU cancer cell line. These plots are used to visually compare the detection of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) regions by two different methods.

Each chromosome plot consists of three horizontal tracks:
1.  **Reference:** The top track is a chromosome ideogram, providing a standard cytogenetic map with banding patterns (G-bands) and the centromere (indicated in red). This serves as a positional reference.
2.  **CytoScan HD:** The middle track displays the LOH regions detected by the Affymetrix CytoScan HD array, a well-established microarray-based platform for detecting copy number variations and LOH. Detected LOH regions are colored purple.
3.  **LongPhase-TO:** The bottom track shows the LOH regions detected using the `LongPhase-TO` phasing tool, which, as established in the previous slide, is optimized for somatic variant phasing from long-read sequencing data. Detected LOH regions are colored blue.

A legend at the bottom of the slide clarifies the color coding for the analysis tracks.

**Figure Legend:** Genome-wide comparison of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) detection in the HCC1395_HKU cell line. Each panel represents a chromosome, from 1 to 22, X, and Y. Within each panel, LOH regions detected by the CytoScan HD array method are shown in purple, while LOH regions detected by the sequencing-based `LongPhase-TO` method are shown in blue. Uncolored regions represent areas with no LOH detected (Non-LOH). The top track in each panel is the reference chromosome ideogram.

**Key Message of the Visualization:** The visualization demonstrates a very high level of concordance between the LOH regions identified by the novel `LongPhase-TO` method and the established `CytoScan HD` reference method. Across most of the genome (e.g., chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, and X), the blue bars (`LongPhase-TO`) almost perfectly overlap with the purple bars (`CytoScan HD`), indicating that the new method successfully identifies the same large-scale LOH events. The `LongPhase-TO` results appear as long, contiguous blocks, which is a direct result of the superior long-range phasing capability demonstrated on the previous slide. This visual validation confirms the effectiveness of using `LongPhase-TO` for accurate LOH analysis from tumor sequencing data.

### **Tables**

The slide includes a legend that functions as a key for interpreting the visualization.

**Table Legend:** This legend explains the color coding used in the chromosome plots to represent the status of LOH detection by different methods.

| Color/Symbol | Description         |
| :----------- | :------------------ |
| ☐ White      | Non-LOH             |
| 🟪 Purple     | CytoScan HD LOH     |
| 🟦 Blue       | LongPhase-TO LOH    |

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide presents the successful application of the `LongPhase-TO` pipeline, which was previously shown to be superior for phasing somatic variants. The key takeaways are:

*   **Validation of LOH Detection:** The `LongPhase-TO` based method for LOH detection is validated by showing strong agreement with results from the gold-standard `CytoScan HD` microarray platform.
*   **High Concordance:** The method accurately identifies known large-scale LOH events across the entire genome of the HCC1395_HKU cancer cell line.
*   **Demonstration of Utility:** The slide effectively demonstrates that the high-quality, long-range phasing from `LongPhase-TO` can be successfully translated into an accurate and reliable downstream application like LOH detection, reinforcing the methodological choices made earlier in the research.

### **Title**
Result : Somatic Calling (Trained on Real Data)

### **Visualizations**

The slide presents a comprehensive benchmark of four different somatic variant calling methods across eight distinct cancer cell line datasets. The results are displayed in a grid of 24 line plots, organized into three rows and eight columns.

*   **Rows (Metrics):** Each row represents a standard performance metric for classification tasks.
    *   The top row shows the **F1-score**, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure of a test's accuracy.
    *   The middle row shows **Precision**, which measures the proportion of true positive calls among all positive calls (i.e., accuracy of positive predictions).
    *   The bottom row shows **Recall** (or sensitivity), which measures the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified.
    All metrics range from 0.0 to 1.0 on the y-axis, where higher values indicate better performance.

*   **Columns (Datasets):** Each column corresponds to a different real-world cancer dataset, including `COLO829_NYGC`, `COLO829_ONT`, `H1437_UCSC`, `H2009_UCSC`, `HCC1395_HKU`, `HCC1395_NYGC`, `HCC1937_UCSC`, and `HCC1954_UCSC`. This demonstrates the robustness of the methods across various sample types and sequencing centers.

*   **Axes and Lines:** For each plot, the x-axis represents the **Purity** of the tumor sample, ranging from 0.2 (20%) to 1.0 (100%). The lines within each plot track the performance of four different methods as purity changes. The methods are combinations of two base somatic variant callers (`ClairS-TO-ssrs` and `DeepSomatic-TO`) with and without the addition of the `LongPhase-TO` tool.

**Figure Legend:** Performance comparison of four somatic variant calling pipelines across eight cancer cell line datasets. Each column represents a unique dataset, and each row corresponds to a performance metric (F1-score, Precision, Recall). The x-axis shows the tumor purity, while the y-axis shows the metric score. The performance of four methods is plotted: `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` (solid light-blue), `ClairS-TO-ssrs` (dashed green), `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)` (solid purple), and `DeepSomatic-TO` (dashed purple).

**Key Message of the Visualization:** The primary message is that integrating `LongPhase-TO` has a significant and distinct impact on the performance of different base callers.
1.  **Enhancement of ClairS:** `LongPhase-TO` consistently improves the F1-score and Precision of `ClairS-TO-ssrs` across nearly all datasets and purity levels. This suggests that `LongPhase-TO` effectively refines the output of `ClairS`, increasing its overall accuracy and reliability. The `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` combination (light blue line) is often the top-performing method in terms of F1-score.
2.  **Precision/Recall Trade-off for DeepSomatic:** When applied to `DeepSomatic-TO`, `LongPhase-TO` dramatically increases its Precision (middle row) but at a significant cost to its Recall (bottom row). `DeepSomatic-TO` alone (dashed purple line) exhibits very high recall but poor precision. Adding `LongPhase-TO` corrects the low precision but over-penalizes recall, leading to a lower overall F1-score compared to `DeepSomatic-TO` alone.
3.  **Effect of Purity:** As expected, the performance of all methods generally improves with increasing tumor purity, as somatic variants become easier to detect against the germline background.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide evaluates the impact of the `LongPhase-TO` tool on somatic variant calling by integrating it with two existing callers, `ClairS` and `DeepSomatic`. The key takeaways are:

*   **`LongPhase-TO` Improves `ClairS`:** Adding `LongPhase-TO` to `ClairS-TO-ssrs` consistently boosts its F1-score and precision, making the combined pipeline a robust and accurate method for somatic calling.
*   **`LongPhase-TO` Modulates `DeepSomatic`:** `LongPhase-TO` significantly improves the low precision of `DeepSomatic-TO` but at the expense of its high recall. This highlights a classic precision-recall trade-off, indicating that while `LongPhase-TO` can filter false positives from `DeepSomatic-TO`, it may be too stringent for this specific caller.
*   **Methodological Validation:** The results validate the utility of `LongPhase-TO` as a refinement step for specific variant callers. The `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` combination emerges as a superior method, justifying its use in downstream applications like the LOH detection shown on the previous slide.

### **Title**
Result : Somatic Calling (Trained on Simulated)

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a performance benchmark of two somatic variant calling pipelines, evaluated across eight different cancer cell line datasets. The results are shown in a grid of 24 line plots, arranged in three rows and eight columns. These results are for models that were trained on simulated data, which contrasts with the previous slide where models were trained on real data.

*   **Rows (Metrics):** Each row represents a different performance metric for evaluating the variant callers.
    *   The top row displays the **F1-score**, a balanced measure of a test's accuracy that combines precision and recall.
    *   The middle row displays **Precision**, indicating the proportion of identified variants that are actual true variants (the accuracy of positive calls).
    *   The bottom row displays **Recall**, also known as sensitivity, which shows the proportion of all true variants that were correctly identified by the caller.
    The y-axis for all metrics ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values signifying better performance.

*   **Columns (Datasets):** Each column corresponds to a specific cancer cell line dataset used for testing the pipelines. The datasets are: `COLO829_NYGC`, `COLO829_ONT`, `H1437_UCSC`, `H2009_UCSC`, `HCC1395_HKU`, `HCC1395_NYGC`, `HCC1937_UCSC`, and `HCC1954_UCSC`.

*   **Axes and Lines:** In each individual plot, the x-axis represents the tumor **Purity**, ranging from 0.2 (20%) to 1.0 (100%). The lines track the performance of two distinct methods as this purity changes: `ClairS-TO-ss` alone, and `ClairS-TO-ss` combined with `LongPhase-TO`.

**Figure Legend:** Performance comparison of two somatic variant calling pipelines across eight cancer cell line datasets, using models trained on simulated data. Each column represents a unique dataset, and each row corresponds to a performance metric (F1-score, Precision, Recall). The x-axis indicates tumor purity, and the y-axis shows the metric score. The performance of two methods is plotted: `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` (solid blue line) and `ClairS-TO-ss` (dashed green line).

**Key Message of the Visualization:** The visualization clearly illustrates the effect of adding `LongPhase-TO` to the `ClairS-TO-ss` pipeline.
1.  **Precision Improvement:** The most consistent trend across all eight datasets is that the `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` pipeline (blue line) achieves significantly higher precision than `ClairS-TO-ss` alone (green line). This indicates that `LongPhase-TO` is effective at filtering out false-positive variant calls.
2.  **Recall Reduction:** Conversely, the `ClairS-TO-ss` pipeline alone (green line) consistently shows higher recall than the combined pipeline. This means that while `LongPhase-TO` improves precision, it does so at the cost of missing some true-positive variants.
3.  **F1-Score Trade-off:** The F1-score (top row) reveals the net effect of this precision-recall trade-off. In several datasets (e.g., `H1437_UCSC`, `HCC1937_UCSC`, `HCC1954_UCSC`), the gain in precision from `LongPhase-TO` outweighs the loss in recall, resulting in a better overall F1-score. In other datasets, the F1-scores are very similar, or `ClairS-TO-ss` alone performs slightly better, suggesting the optimal choice may be dataset-dependent.

### **Tables**

A legend at the bottom of the slide identifies the two methods being compared in the plots.

**Table Legend:** This key defines the line styles and colors for the two computational methods benchmarked.

| Line Style and Color                 | Method Name                  |
|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| <span style="color:blue;">—●—</span> | LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)   |
| <span style="color:green;">--▲--</span> | ClairS-TO-ss                 |

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide evaluates the impact of adding the `LongPhase-TO` tool to the `ClairS-TO-ss` somatic variant caller, using models that were trained on simulated data. The key findings are:

*   **`LongPhase-TO` Acts as a Precision-Enhancing Filter:** Integrating `LongPhase-TO` consistently boosts the precision of `ClairS-TO-ss` across all tested datasets.
*   **A Clear Precision-Recall Trade-off:** The improvement in precision comes at the expense of recall. `LongPhase-TO` filters out some true variants along with the false ones.
*   **Overall Performance is Context-Dependent:** The net effect on the F1-score varies. The combined `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` pipeline provides a better balance and higher overall accuracy in several cases, particularly where the baseline precision of `ClairS-TO-ss` is lower. This validates `LongPhase-TO` as a useful post-processing step for refining somatic variant calls, though its application may lead to a more conservative set of results.

### **Title**
Result : Tumor Purity Prediction

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents an evaluation of four different methods for predicting tumor purity. The results are displayed in a grid of eight scatter plots, arranged in two rows and four columns, with each plot corresponding to a specific cancer cell line dataset.

*   **Grid Layout:** The slide is structured as a 2x4 grid. Each cell contains a plot for a unique dataset: `COLO829_ONT`, `COLO829_NYGC`, `H1437_UCSC`, `H2009_UCSC` in the top row, and `HCC1395_HKU`, `HCC1395_NYGC`, `HCC1937_UCSC`, `HCC1954_UCSC` in the bottom row.

*   **Axes:**
    *   The **x-axis** of each plot is labeled "Simulated Purity" and represents the known, ground-truth tumor purity of the sample, ranging from 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%).
    *   The **y-axis** of each plot is labeled "Estimated Purity" and shows the purity value predicted by the different computational methods, also ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

*   **Data Representation:**
    *   Each colored line tracks the performance of a specific purity estimation method across different simulated purity levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0).
    *   A dashed grey line, labeled "Ideal Prediction," represents the y=x line. This line indicates a perfect prediction, where the estimated purity exactly matches the simulated purity. The closer a method's line is to this dashed line, the more accurate its prediction.

**Figure Legend:** Comparison of tumor purity prediction accuracy for four methods across eight different cancer cell line datasets. Each plot shows the estimated purity (y-axis) versus the simulated ground-truth purity (x-axis). The performance of four methods is shown: `Ascat(Tumor-Normal pair)` (red), `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ssrs)` (blue), `LongPhase-TO(ClairS-TO-ss)` (green), and `LongPhase-TO(DeepSomatic-TO)` (purple). The dashed grey line indicates an ideal, perfectly accurate prediction.

**Key Message of the Visualization:**
1.  **Superior Performance of `LongPhase-TO` Methods:** The three methods based on `LongPhase-TO` (blue, green, and purple lines) consistently provide accurate purity estimations. Their predictions closely follow the "Ideal Prediction" line across most datasets and purity levels.
2.  **Poor Performance of `Ascat`:** The `Ascat` method (red line) performs erratically and is often highly inaccurate. For several datasets (e.g., `COLO829_NYGC`, `H1437_UCSC`, `HCC1395_HKU`, `HCC1395_NYGC`, `HCC1937_UCSC`), `Ascat` significantly overestimates purity, especially at low simulated purity values. For instance, it predicts a purity of 1.0 when the true value is 0.2 or 0.4.
3.  **Consistency Among `LongPhase-TO` Variants:** The three variations of the `LongPhase-TO` pipeline (using `ClairS-TO-ssrs`, `ClairS-TO-ss`, or `DeepSomatic-TO` as the underlying somatic caller) yield very similar and robust results. The choice of the base caller appears to have a minimal effect on the final purity estimation.
4.  **Low Purity is Challenging:** While the `LongPhase-TO` methods are generally robust, there is some minor deviation from the ideal line at the lowest simulated purity (0.2), where they tend to slightly underestimate or overestimate the purity. However, their performance is still vastly superior to `Ascat`.

### **Tables**

### **Summary of Key Messages**

Following the evaluation of somatic calling performance on the previous slide, this slide assesses a related capability: the accurate prediction of tumor purity. The key findings are:

*   **`LongPhase-TO` Provides Accurate Purity Estimates:** The pipelines incorporating `LongPhase-TO` are highly effective at predicting tumor purity, with results that closely match the ground truth across a range of datasets and purity levels.
*   **`Ascat` is Unreliable for Purity Estimation in this Context:** The standard `Ascat` method demonstrates poor and inconsistent performance, making it an unreliable choice for purity estimation on these datasets.
*   **Robustness Across Base Callers:** The accuracy of purity estimation by `LongPhase-TO` is not heavily dependent on the specific underlying somatic variant caller (`ClairS-TO-ssrs`, `ClairS-TO-ss`, or `DeepSomatic-TO`), indicating the robustness of the `LongPhase-TO` estimation algorithm itself. This suggests that the tool can reliably estimate a crucial sample characteristic in addition to improving variant calls.

### **Title**
Result : Haplotagging somatic variant

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a visualization, likely from a genome browser like IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), to illustrate the process and result of haplotagging a somatic variant using long-read sequencing data. The image is divided into several horizontal tracks, each providing a different layer of information about a specific genomic region.

*   **Top Track ("Somatic"):** This track at the very top indicates the positions of genetic variants detected in the sample. The vertical lines represent variant calls. The tall, dark blue line in the center likely highlights the specific somatic variant of interest for this demonstration. Other, fainter lines (light blue/cyan) may represent other variants, possibly germline ones.

*   **Coverage Track:** The gray histogram-like track directly below the "Somatic" track shows the read coverage across this genomic region. The label `[0 - 41]` on the left indicates that the coverage depth in this area ranges up to 41x.

*   **Haplotype Tracks:** The main body of the visualization consists of three tracks that show sequencing reads segregated by haplotype. This segregation is the result of a process called "phasing."
    *   **HP1 (Haplotype 1):** This track, with a pink background, contains all the long sequencing reads (shown as horizontal white bars) that have been computationally assigned to the first parental chromosome (Haplotype 1).
    *   **HP2 (Haplotype 2):** This track, with a light blue background, displays reads assigned to the second parental chromosome (Haplotype 2).
    *   **HP2-1 (Sub-haplotype):** This track, with a light green background, appears to be a subset of Haplotype 2. It groups reads that not only belong to Haplotype 2 but also share a specific characteristic, which in this case is the somatic mutation.

*   **Read-level Details:** Within each haplotype track, the long horizontal bars represent individual sequencing reads. Small, colored vertical ticks on these reads indicate positions where the read's sequence differs from the reference genome. By inspecting the alignment of these ticks with the variant calls in the top track, one can see which reads support which variant.

**Figure Legend:** A genome browser view demonstrating the successful haplotagging of a somatic variant. The visualization shows long sequencing reads partitioned into three groups: Haplotype 1 (HP1, pink), Haplotype 2 (HP2, blue), and a sub-haplotype (HP2-1, green). The top track marks the locations of called variants, with the central dark blue line indicating the somatic variant of interest. The reads in the HP2-1 track all contain this somatic mutation (visible as aligned vertical ticks), demonstrating that the mutation has been successfully assigned to a specific sub-clone on Haplotype 2.

**Key Message of the Visualization:**
1.  **Successful Phasing:** The method has effectively separated the long reads into distinct groups corresponding to the two parental haplotypes (HP1 and HP2).
2.  **Precise Haplotagging of a Somatic Variant:** The key result is that the somatic variant (central dark blue line) is shown to exist exclusively on reads within the "HP2-1" track. This means the analysis has not only identified the mutation but also determined its chromosome of origin (Haplotype 2).
3.  **Identification of a Sub-clone:** The creation of the "HP2-1" track suggests the identification of a tumor sub-clone. The somatic mutation is not present on all Haplotype 2 reads, but only on a specific subset, which has been isolated here. This demonstrates the method's ability to resolve intra-tumor heterogeneity.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

Building on the previous slide which validated the performance of the `LongPhase-TO` pipeline, this slide provides a concrete visual example of one of its key capabilities. The main takeaway is the successful haplotagging of a somatic variant. The visualization clearly demonstrates that the analysis pipeline can:

*   Use long-read data to phase a genomic region, separating reads by their parental chromosome of origin (Haplotype 1 vs. Haplotype 2).
*   Pinpoint the specific haplotype on which a somatic mutation has occurred. In this case, the mutation is on Haplotype 2.
*   Potentially identify and resolve tumor sub-clones by showing that the somatic mutation is carried by only a subset of reads from that haplotype. This ability to link a mutation to its specific chromosomal background is critical for understanding the evolution and genetic makeup of a tumor.

### **Title**
Result : Haplotagging somatic and LOH

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a complex result in a genome browser view, demonstrating the pipeline's ability to simultaneously identify and phase a somatic point mutation and a large-scale Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) event using long-read sequencing data. The visualization is annotated to highlight these two distinct genomic alterations.

*   **Overall Layout:** The image displays several horizontal tracks representing a specific region of the genome. The top track shows read coverage, while the three main tracks below show long sequencing reads that have been separated (phased) based on their haplotype of origin.
*   **Coverage and Variant Track:** The topmost gray histogram shows the read coverage across the displayed region, with the scale `[0 - 64]` on the far left indicating a maximum depth of 64x. Small vertical colored lines within this track represent nucleotide differences from the reference genome.
*   **Haplotype Tracks:** The core of the visualization consists of three tracks showing phased reads:
    *   **HP1 (Haplotype 1):** This track, with a light purple background, groups all long reads assigned to the first parental chromosome.
    *   **HP2 (Haplotype 2):** This track, with a light red/pink background, contains reads assigned to the second parental chromosome.
    *   **HP2-1 (Sub-haplotype):** This track, with a light green background, isolates a specific subset of reads from Haplotype 2. These reads represent a sub-clonal population that carries a unique mutation.
*   **Annotations:**
    *   **"Somatic Variant":** An arrow points to a specific genomic coordinate. At this location, a distinct vertical blue line is visible on the reads within the **HP2-1** track, indicating that this mutation is present only in this sub-clonal population and is linked to Haplotype 2.
    *   **"LOH":** A long horizontal arrow spans the entire left portion of the view. In this region, the **HP1** track is completely devoid of reads, while the **HP2** track shows normal read coverage. This stark absence of one haplotype is the definitive signature of a Loss of Heterozygosity event, where the tumor cells have lost the chromosomal segment corresponding to Haplotype 1.

**Figure Legend:** A genome browser visualization from a cancer sample analysis, illustrating the simultaneous detection of a Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) event and a phased somatic point variant. The long sequencing reads are partitioned into Haplotype 1 (HP1, purple), Haplotype 2 (HP2, red), and a sub-clonal group from Haplotype 2 (HP2-1, green). The region marked "LOH" shows a complete absence of reads from HP1, indicating the physical loss of this chromosomal region. In a separate, heterozygous region to the right, a "Somatic Variant" is identified exclusively on the HP2-1 reads, demonstrating that it is a sub-clonal mutation that occurred on the retained Haplotype 2.

**Key Message of the Visualization:**
1.  **Clear Detection of LOH:** The method successfully identifies a large LOH event by demonstrating the complete absence of reads belonging to Haplotype 1 across a significant genomic region.
2.  **Phasing of a Somatic Variant:** The pipeline precisely assigns a somatic point mutation to its parental chromosome of origin (Haplotype 2) and further resolves it to a specific sub-clone (HP2-1).
3.  **Resolving Complex Tumor Genetics:** The visualization powerfully illustrates how different types of tumor-driving events (a large structural loss and a specific point mutation) can be resolved and correctly phased. It reveals that the LOH affected Haplotype 1, while a subsequent somatic mutation occurred on the remaining Haplotype 2, providing crucial insights into the evolutionary history of the tumor.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide presents a key result, advancing from the previous example by tackling a more complex genomic scenario found in cancer. The primary message is that the analysis pipeline is capable of not only haplotagging individual somatic variants but also identifying large-scale structural events like Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) and understanding their relationship.

The visualization provides compelling evidence that:
*   The method can detect and phase different classes of mutations simultaneously.
*   It can reveal the specific parental chromosome affected by LOH (in this case, Haplotype 1 was lost).
*   It can concurrently pinpoint that a separate somatic mutation arose on the other, retained chromosome (Haplotype 2).
*   By isolating the somatic variant into a sub-haplotype (HP2-1), the method demonstrates its power in resolving tumor heterogeneity and reconstructing the sequence of mutational events.

### **Title**
Conclusion

This slide serves as the conclusion of the presentation, summarizing the main contributions of the research. The study introduced a new bioinformatics tool named **LongPhase-TO**, which is a tumor-only analysis pipeline designed specifically for long-read sequencing data. The slide outlines four primary achievements of this tool.

1.  **Somatic Phasing**: This is the first key contribution. LongPhase-TO enables a haplotype-resolved analysis of somatic mutations. This means it can determine which parental chromosome (haplotype) a specific cancer mutation occurred on. This capability extends to complex regions, such as those affected by Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), as demonstrated in the previous slide where a somatic variant was correctly assigned to the retained haplotype.

2.  **Robust LOH Detection**: The second contribution is the tool's ability to accurately identify large, chromosome-scale LOH events. The slide emphasizes that the method avoids the fragmentation issues that can plague other approaches and that its performance is comparable to established array-based standards for LOH detection. This directly relates to the clear LOH event shown in the previous slide's visualization.

3.  **Enhanced Somatic Variant Calling**: The third point highlights an improvement in the precision of detecting somatic variants. This enhancement is particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as samples with low tumor purity. The improvement is achieved by integrating the phasing information with graph-based modeling techniques.

4.  **Accurate Tumor Purity Estimation**: The final contribution is the pipeline's ability to predict the tumor purity of a sample. This is accomplished by analyzing signals of haplotype imbalance and LOH ratios directly from the tumor sequencing data. A significant advantage of this method is that it does not require a matched normal sample, which is a key feature of a "tumor-only" (TO) pipeline and simplifies clinical or research workflows.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide concludes the presentation by summarizing the four major contributions of the **LongPhase-TO** software. The central message is that this new pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing tumor genetics using only long-read sequencing data from a tumor sample.

The key takeaways are:
*   **Novel Tool:** The study successfully developed **LongPhase-TO**, a specialized tumor-only pipeline for long-read data.
*   **Advanced Cancer Genomics:** The tool provides deeper biological insights by not just identifying mutations, but by phasing them (assigning them to a specific parental chromosome), even in complex LOH regions. This was visually proven in the preceding result slide.
*   **High Performance and Reliability:** LongPhase-TO is robust and accurate, capable of detecting large-scale LOH events reliably and improving variant calling precision, especially in difficult low-purity samples.
*   **Clinical and Research Utility:** By eliminating the need for a matched normal sample to estimate tumor purity, the pipeline is more cost-effective and applicable to a wider range of clinical scenarios where only tumor tissue is available.

### **Title**
LOH Detection : Genotype Assignment and Heterozygosity Ratio-Based Classification

This slide presents the methodology for detecting Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) events. It explains a two-step approach: first, assigning a genotype (homozygous or heterozygous) to variants based on their allele frequency, and second, using a heterozygosity ratio to classify entire genomic regions as either LOH or Non-LOH.

### **Visualizations**

The slide features two plots that visually justify the LOH detection strategy.

**Figure 1: Variant Genotype Distribution**

This violin plot compares the distribution of Variant Allele Frequencies (VAF) for genetic variants found in "Non-LOH" regions (blue) versus "LOH" regions (green).
*   In **Non-LOH** regions, the distribution is bimodal, with a large, wide peak centered at a VAF of 0.5. This signifies a high prevalence of heterozygous variants, where both parental alleles are present in roughly equal measure. A smaller peak is visible near a VAF of 1.0, representing homozygous variants.
*   In **LOH** regions, the distribution is starkly different. The peak at 0.5 has almost completely disappeared, and the distribution is strongly skewed towards a VAF of 1.0 (or, implicitly, 0.0). This indicates that one of the two parental alleles has been lost, causing most variants to appear homozygous.
*   A dashed line at VAF = 0.8 is shown, which corresponds to the threshold used in the equations to classify variants as either homozygous (Hom) or heterozygous (Het).

**Figure 2: LOH Classification by Heterozygosity Ratio**

This box plot displays the distribution of the "Heterozygosity ratio" for Non-LOH and LOH regions. This ratio quantifies the proportion of heterozygous variants in a region.
*   For **Non-LOH** regions, the heterozygosity ratio is high, with a median value around 0.55. This confirms that these regions contain a substantial fraction of heterozygous sites.
*   For **LOH** regions, the heterozygosity ratio is consistently close to zero. This demonstrates a near-complete loss of heterozygosity.
*   The two distributions are clearly distinct and separable. A dashed line labeled **H<sub>r</sub>** is drawn at a ratio of 0.09, representing the classification threshold. Regions with a ratio below this line are classified as LOH.

**Key Messages of the Visualizations:**
The plots provide strong visual evidence for the proposed LOH detection method. They show that LOH regions are characterized by a dramatic loss of heterozygous variants (VAF ≈ 0.5) and a corresponding increase in homozygous variants (VAF ≈ 1.0). The "Heterozygosity ratio" emerges as a highly effective metric for distinguishing between LOH and Non-LOH regions, as there is a clear separation between the two classes.

### **Equations**

The slide formalizes the classification logic with a set of rules and formulas.

The first rule explains how individual variants are counted as either homozygous or heterozygous based on their Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) and pre-existing genotype information. A variant is considered homozygous if its VAF is 0.8 or greater, or if it was already genotyped as homozygous. Otherwise, it is counted as heterozygous.

The second equation defines the **Heterozygosity ratio (H<sub>r</sub>)**. It is calculated as the total count of heterozygous variants divided by the sum of heterozygous and homozygous variants in a given genomic window.

The third rule defines the final classification step. A region is classified as **LOH** if its Heterozygosity ratio (H<sub>r</sub>) is less than 0.09. Otherwise, it is classified as **Non-LOH**.

```markdown
For each Variant Allele Frequency (VAF)
$$
\begin{cases}
  \text{Hom count ++,} & \text{if (VAF} \ge \text{0.8) or (Genotype == Hom)} \\
  \text{Het count ++,} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
H_r (\text{Heterozygosity ratio}) = \frac{\text{Het Count}}{\text{Het Count} + \text{Hom Count}}
$$

$$
\text{LOH type} = \begin{cases}
  \text{LOH,} & \text{if } H_r < 0.09 \\
  \text{Non-LOH,} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
```

**Key Messages of the Equations:**
The equations provide a clear and simple algorithm for LOH detection. By counting variants based on VAF, calculating a simple ratio, and applying a single threshold (H<sub>r</sub> < 0.09), the method can systematically and automatically classify genomic regions. This formalized approach is robust and directly supported by the data distributions shown in the plots.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details a robust, data-driven methodology for the detection of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). The core message is that LOH can be reliably identified by quantifying the depletion of heterozygous variants.

The key takeaways are:
*   **Biomarker for LOH:** The absence of heterozygous variants (with allele frequencies around 0.5) is a strong signal of an LOH event.
*   **Quantitative Metric:** The "Heterozygosity ratio" is introduced as a powerful metric that effectively summarizes this signal for a given genomic region.
*   **Simple and Effective Algorithm:** A straightforward classification algorithm is presented: count variants, calculate the heterozygosity ratio, and apply a threshold (H<sub>r</sub> < 0.09) to make a definitive call of LOH or Non-LOH. This method is shown to be highly effective, as the two classes are well-separated.

### **Title**
Somatic Variant Calling : Rationale for Pattern Selection

This slide presents a rationale for selecting specific data patterns to improve the accuracy of somatic variant calling. It evaluates different patterns based on their contribution to True Positive and False Positive variant calls, aiming to identify the most reliable signatures of true somatic mutations. This follows the previous discussion on LOH detection by moving to the broader topic of identifying all types of somatic variants.

### **Visualizations**

**Figure 1: True Positive vs. False Positive Rates for Different Variant Patterns**

This bar chart compares the performance of various predefined patterns used in somatic variant calling. The y-axis represents the "Vote Percentage," which indicates the proportion of all True Positive or False Positive calls that fall into a specific pattern category. The x-axis lists these different patterns, which appear to be defined by characteristics of sequencing reads (e.g., `MID_HIGH_SA_PAR`).

*   **Legend:** The blue bars represent **TP (True Positives)**, which are correctly identified somatic variants. The red bars represent **FP (False Positives)**, which are variants that were incorrectly called as somatic.

The chart is annotated to group the patterns into three distinct categories based on their performance:

1.  **V<sub>H</sub>(High):** This group includes patterns (e.g., `MID_HIGH_SA_PAR`, `LEFT_HIGH_SA_PAR`) that show a relatively high rate of True Positives (up to ~5%) while having a very low rate of False Positives. These are considered high-confidence patterns, as they are strong indicators of a true somatic variant.

2.  **V<sub>L</sub>(Low):** This group includes patterns that contribute a smaller percentage of True Positives (~1-2%) but also maintain a very low False Positive rate. While less frequent, these patterns are still reliable.

3.  **V<sub>N</sub>(NonSomatic):** This section is dominated by the **"DISAGREE"** category. This category has by far the highest False Positive rate (over 30%) and also a very high True Positive rate (~15%). This suggests that when different variant calling methods or evidence types disagree, it leads to a large number of both correct and incorrect calls, making this a highly unreliable and ambiguous category.

**Key Messages of the Visualization:**
The primary message is that not all evidence for a somatic variant is equal. By breaking down variant calls into specific patterns, one can identify which patterns are reliable (high TP, low FP) and which are not. The `V_H` patterns are clearly the most desirable for high-confidence somatic variant calling. The "DISAGREE" category is a major source of error (high FPs) and requires special handling, likely filtering or careful re-evaluation, to improve the overall accuracy of the variant calling process.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide provides a data-driven justification for a pattern-based approach to somatic variant calling. The key messages are:

*   **Pattern-Based Filtering is Crucial:** The accuracy of somatic variant calling can be significantly improved by evaluating the specific patterns of evidence supporting each variant.
*   **Identification of High-Confidence Patterns:** The analysis identifies a set of "High" confidence patterns (`V_H`) that are highly enriched for True Positives and have minimal False Positives. Prioritizing variants with these patterns would increase the precision of the final call set.
*   **Ambiguity of "Disagree" Calls:** The "DISAGREE" category is highlighted as a major challenge, contributing the largest proportion of False Positives. This indicates that disagreement between callers or evidence types is a strong signal of unreliability.
*   **Overall Strategy:** The slide argues for a strategy that selects for variants supported by high-confidence patterns (`V_H` and `V_L`) while likely filtering out or down-weighting those falling into the ambiguous "DISAGREE" category.

This is a detailed analysis of the slide's content.

### **Title**
Somatic Variant Calling : Pattern Artifact Filtering

### **Context**
Following the previous slide's identification of high-confidence (`V_H`) and non-somatic (`V_N`) patterns, this slide presents a quantitative method called "Pattern Artifact Filtering" to leverage this classification. It introduces a specific metric, the "Somatic path ratio," and a threshold (`τ`) to systematically filter out artifacts and improve the precision of somatic variant calls.

### **Visualizations**

**Figure 1: Conceptual Diagram of Pattern Artifact Filtering**

Located in the top-left and center, this series of diagrams illustrates the core concept of the filtering method.
*   The left-most part shows an alignment of sequencing reads, with a C->T somatic mutation present in some reads (haplotype 1) against a background of the reference base G (haplotype 2).
*   The central graph model represents this genomic region as a graph, where nodes are bases (A, C, T, G) and edges represent observed sequences. It explicitly defines two types of paths:
    *   **V<sub>H</sub>**: The high-confidence somatic path (G -> T -> G), representing the true mutation.
    *   **V<sub>N</sub>**: A non-somatic path (A -> C -> T), likely representing the reference or germline sequence.
*   This model is used to calculate a ratio of evidence supporting the somatic path versus all other paths.

**Figure 2: Distribution of VOTE_RATIO for True and False Positives**

Located at the bottom-left, these two histograms compare the distribution of a metric called "VOTE_RATIO" (equivalent to the "Somatic path ratio") for True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).
*   **Legend:** Blue bars represent TPs, and red bars represent FPs.
*   **True Positives (TP) Histogram (Left):** This plot shows that the vast majority of true somatic variants have a very high VOTE_RATIO, with a strong peak near 1.0. This indicates that for true variants, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the somatic path.
*   **False Positives (FP) Histogram (Right):** This plot shows a more spread-out distribution for false positives. While some FPs have a high ratio, a significant portion has a VOTE_RATIO lower than 1.0.
*   A dashed vertical line indicates a proposed filtering threshold, **τ ≈ 0.8**.

**Key Messages of the Visualizations (Figures 1 & 2):**
The diagrams introduce the concept of quantifying evidence for a somatic variant as a ratio of somatic path support to total support. The histograms provide a strong rationale for this method, demonstrating that the "VOTE_RATIO" is a powerful discriminator between true and false positive calls. By setting a threshold `τ` at 0.8, one can eliminate a large number of FPs while retaining most of the TPs, thereby increasing the precision of the final variant set.

**Figure 3: VOTE_RATIO Distributions at Different Tumor Purity Levels**

Located on the right side of the slide, this panel displays a series of paired histograms (TP in blue, FP in red) showing the VOTE_RATIO distributions at varying levels of tumor sample purity (from 1.0 down to 0.2).

**Key Message of the Visualization (Figure 3):**
This analysis demonstrates the robustness of the filtering method. As tumor purity decreases, the VOTE_RATIO for true positives naturally decreases (the blue peak shifts slightly to the left), because the proportion of reads with the somatic variant is lower. However, even at low purity levels like 0.2, the TP distribution remains largely concentrated at high ratio values and distinct from the FP distribution. This shows that the VOTE_RATIO remains an effective filtering metric across a wide range of clinically relevant tumor purities.

### **Equations**

The slide presents the core filtering rule and an example calculation. The rule is that a variant is kept if its somatic path ratio is greater than a threshold `τ`.

The example calculation demonstrates how this ratio is computed for a candidate variant. Here, the evidence for the somatic path is '2', while the total evidence from all paths is '1+0+0+2 = 3' (the numbers likely represent read counts supporting different paths). The resulting ratio of 2/3 is then compared to the threshold `τ`. Since 2/3 is less than a typical `τ` of 0.8, this variant would be filtered out as a likely artifact.

```markdown
Somatic path ratio > τ

Example:
(2) / (1 + 0 + 0 + 2) = 2/3 < τ
```

**Key Message of the Equations:**
The key message is that the abstract concept of pattern confidence can be translated into a simple, quantitative rule. By calculating the ratio of somatic evidence to total evidence and applying a threshold, the algorithm can make a data-driven decision to either keep a variant or filter it as a likely artifact.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide details a "Pattern Artifact Filtering" strategy to refine somatic variant calls. The main takeaways are:

*   **Quantitative Filtering:** A "Somatic path ratio" (or VOTE_RATIO) is proposed as a robust metric to quantify the confidence in a somatic variant call.
*   **Effective Discrimination:** This ratio effectively separates True Positives, which consistently show high ratios, from False Positives, which have a broader and lower distribution of ratios.
*   **Threshold-Based Approach:** A simple threshold (`τ ≈ 0.8`) on this ratio can significantly improve the precision of variant calling by removing a large fraction of false positives while retaining the vast majority of true positives.
*   **Robustness to Purity:** The method is shown to be effective across a wide range of tumor purity levels, making it applicable to diverse real-world samples.

### **Title**
Somatic Variant Calling : V_L Somatic Variant Detection Formula

### **Context**
This slide presents a quantitative formula and a threshold-based method for detecting somatic variants. The core of the method is a ratio, termed "Vlow Ratio," which is used to discriminate between true somatic variants and false positives based on the supporting evidence derived from a sequence graph model. The effectiveness of this filtering approach is evaluated across different tumor purity levels.

### **Visualizations**

**Figure 1: Conceptual Diagram**

Located at the top left, this diagram shows a sequence graph model, which is a common way to represent multiple sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome. An arrow points from this graph to the "Somatic Variant Detection Formula," indicating that the variables in the formula (`V_L` and `V_N`) are derived from evidence within this graph structure.

**Figure 2: Vlow Ratio Distribution for True and False Positives**

Located at the bottom left, this figure consists of two histograms comparing the distribution of the "Vlow Ratio" for known True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).
*   **Legend:** Blue bars represent True Positives (TP), and red bars represent False Positives (FP).
*   **True Positives (TP) Histogram (Left):** This plot shows that the Vlow Ratio for true variants is broadly distributed between 0.0 and 1.0. A significant number of TPs have a ratio greater than 0.2.
*   **False Positives (FP) Histogram (Right):** This plot reveals that the vast majority of false positives have a very low Vlow Ratio, with a large, sharp peak near 0.0.
*   A dashed vertical line labeled **θ** is placed at approximately 0.2 on the x-axis of both plots, representing a proposed filtering threshold.

**Key Message of the Visualization (Figure 2):** The Vlow Ratio is a powerful feature for distinguishing true variants from artifacts. Most false positives have a ratio close to zero, while true positives are more broadly distributed. Setting a threshold `θ` at ~0.2 allows for the removal of a substantial number of false positives while retaining a majority of the true positive variants.

**Figure 3: Vlow Ratio Distributions at Different Tumor Purity Levels**

Located on the right side of the slide, this panel displays a series of paired histograms (TP in blue, FP in red) showing the Vlow Ratio distributions at decreasing levels of tumor sample purity, from 1.0 (100%) down to 0.2 (20%).

**Key Message of the Visualization (Figure 3):** This analysis demonstrates the behavior of the Vlow Ratio under different conditions. As tumor purity decreases, the signal from the somatic variant weakens, causing the distribution for True Positives (blue histograms) to shift towards lower ratios. However, the distribution for False Positives (red histograms) remains strongly concentrated at very low ratios across all purity levels. This indicates that even at low purities like 20%, the threshold `θ` remains effective at filtering out a large proportion of false positives.

### **Equations**

The slide presents the central formula for this method under the heading "Somatic Variant Detection Formula." It defines the condition a candidate variant must meet to be considered somatic.

The formula states that the ratio of evidence for the variant path (`V_L`) to the total evidence for both the variant and non-variant paths (`V_L + V_N`) must be greater than or equal to a threshold, `θ`. `V_L` likely represents the evidence (e.g., read counts) for the potential somatic variant, while `V_N` represents the evidence for the non-somatic (e.g., reference or germline) allele. The entire ratio represents the variant allele frequency as calculated from the graph.

```markdown
V_L / (V_L + V_N) ≥ θ
```

**Key Message of the Equations:**
The decision to call a somatic variant is made using a simple, quantitative rule. A variant is accepted if its allele frequency (the Vlow Ratio) exceeds a predefined minimum threshold `θ`. This formalizes the filtering process based on the relative evidence supporting the variant.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide outlines a method for somatic variant detection based on a calculated "Vlow Ratio." The main takeaways are:

*   **Quantitative Filtering:** A specific formula, `V_L / (V_L + V_N)`, is used to calculate a ratio representing the strength of evidence for a somatic variant.
*   **Effective Discrimination:** Histograms demonstrate that this ratio effectively separates the majority of False Positives (which have a very low ratio) from True Positives (which have a higher, more distributed ratio).
*   **Threshold-Based Calling:** A threshold `θ` (empirically set around 0.2) is applied to this ratio to filter out low-confidence calls, which are predominantly false positives.
*   **Robustness to Purity:** The method maintains its effectiveness in discriminating between true and false calls even when tumor purity is as low as 20%, making it suitable for a range of clinical samples.

### **Title**
Somatic Variant Calling : Tumor Purity Prediction Equation

### **Visualizations**

This slide uses a comprehensive diagram to illustrate how tumor purity affects the allele frequencies of germline and somatic variants, and how this relationship can be used to identify specific genomic patterns.

**Figure 1: Cellular Origin of Variants**

Located on the far left, this diagram depicts the genetic makeup of normal and tumor cells.
*   **Normal cells:** Shown with a pair of homologous chromosomes. A heterozygous germline variant is present, indicated by a blue-colored band on each chromosome at the same locus.
*   **Tumor cells:** Also shown with a pair of homologous chromosomes. These cells carry the same heterozygous germline variant (blue bands) as the normal cells. Additionally, one of the chromosomes has acquired a new heterozygous somatic variant, indicated by an orange-colored band.
*   **Key Message:** This establishes the fundamental difference between the two cell types: normal cells only have germline variants, while tumor cells have both germline and somatic variants.

**Figure 2: Effect of Tumor Purity on Allele Frequency Distributions**

This central part of the slide illustrates how mixing normal and tumor cells at different ratios (tumor purity) impacts the observable allele frequencies. The flow is shown for purity levels of 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2.
*   **Purity Levels and Cell Mixtures:** Each purity level is accompanied by a small icon representing the proportion of tumor cells (orange outline) to normal cells (blue outline) in a sample. For instance, a purity of 1.0 means the sample is 100% tumor cells, while 0.2 means it is 20% tumor cells and 80% normal cells.
*   **Allele Frequency Plots:** For each purity level, a graph plots variant counts against allele frequency (from 0 to 1).
    *   **Legend:** The blue curve represents the distribution for the germline variant, and the orange curve represents the distribution for the somatic variant.
    *   **Germline Variant (Blue Curve):** The peak for the germline variant remains centered at an allele frequency of 0.5 across all purity levels. This is because this heterozygous variant is present in all cells (both normal and tumor) in the sample.
    *   **Somatic Variant (Orange Curve):** The peak for the somatic variant shifts depending on the tumor purity. At 100% purity, its peak is also at 0.5 (as it is heterozygous in the tumor cells). As purity decreases, the somatic variant becomes diluted by the normal cells that lack it, causing its allele frequency peak to shift towards zero. For example, at 20% purity, the peak is near 0.1 (0.5 allele frequency * 0.2 purity).
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The allele frequency of somatic variants is directly proportional to tumor purity, while the allele frequency of heterozygous germline variants remains stable at 0.5. This difference in behavior allows for the statistical separation of the two variant types in mixed samples, provided the purity is not 100%.

**Figure 3: Pattern Detection based on Allele Frequency Separation**

Located on the right, this part of the diagram shows the outcome of analyzing the variant data.
*   **High Purity (e.g., 1.0):** At 100% purity, the allele frequency distributions for germline and somatic variants overlap significantly. The diagram shows that this makes it impossible to resolve the underlying genomic pattern. It displays a set of aligned reads (A-C-A and G-T-G) but concludes that a distinct pattern cannot be identified (marked with an "X").
*   **Lower Purity (e.g., 0.6):** At lower purities, the distinct allele frequencies allow the separation of reads belonging to the germline variant from those belonging to the somatic variant. This enables the reconstruction of the haplotype, or the specific sequence of variants on a single chromosome. The diagram shows a sequence graph where the germline variant (A vs. G) and the somatic variant (C vs. T) are resolved into a clear pattern: the somatic C-to-T mutation is linked to the chromosome carrying the 'G' germline allele, forming a G-T-G path.
*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** By exploiting the differential allele frequencies caused by varying tumor purity, it is possible to identify which germline allele is physically linked to a specific somatic mutation. This "pattern" provides valuable information about the tumor's clonal evolution but is only detectable when the allele frequency distributions are separable (i.e., at purities less than 1.0).

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide explains the principle behind using tumor purity to analyze somatic variants. The core messages are:

*   **Differential Allele Frequencies:** Heterozygous somatic variants have an allele frequency that is dependent on tumor purity, whereas heterozygous germline variants have a stable allele frequency of approximately 0.5.
*   **Separation of Signals:** This difference allows for the statistical separation of somatic and germline variant signals in samples with a mixture of tumor and normal cells (i.e., purity < 1.0).
*   **Pattern Identification:** Once separated, the linkage between a somatic mutation and a nearby germline variant can be determined. This "pattern" reveals which parental chromosome acquired the somatic mutation.
*   **Purity as a Prerequisite:** The ability to detect these patterns is conditional on tumor purity. At 100% purity, the signals overlap, and the pattern is obscured. At lower purities, the signals separate, revealing the pattern. This principle forms the basis for a "Tumor Purity Prediction Equation," which is alluded to in the title.

### **Title**
Somatic Variant Calling: Iterative Refinement for High Purity Samples

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a detailed workflow diagram illustrating a computational pipeline for somatic variant calling, with a special emphasis on an iterative refinement process for high-purity tumor samples.

**Figure 1: Workflow for Somatic Variant Calling and Phasing**

The diagram outlines a multi-step process from sequencing data to tumor purity estimation. A legend in the top-left corner defines the color-coding for alleles: grey for Reference, blue for Germline, orange for Somatic, and yellow for Non-Somatic (e.g., sequencing errors).

1.  **Input - Long-read Sequencing:** The process begins with long-read sequencing data, depicted as a set of DNA reads. These reads contain various types of alleles: reference (grey), heterozygous germline variants (blue), potential somatic variants (orange), and non-somatic variants/errors (yellow).

2.  **Somatic Variant Candidate Generation:** The sequencing reads are processed to identify all potential variant sites, creating a pool of "Somatic Variant Candidates." This is represented by a circle containing dots of all four colors, indicating an un-filtered collection of germline, somatic, and non-somatic variants.

3.  **Parallel Processing Paths:** The workflow splits into two main branches:
    *   **Main Path (Left):**
        *   **Somatic Variant Candidate Selection:** This step filters the initial candidates. The diagram shows the removal of the yellow "non-somatic" dot, signifying the elimination of likely sequencing errors or artifacts.
        *   **Somatic Variant Calling:** Further refinement leads to the identification of true somatic (orange) and germline (blue) variants.
        *   **Phasing:** This crucial step uses the long-read information to determine which variants co-occur on the same chromosome (haplotype). The output shows two distinct haplotypes, labeled HP1-1 and HP2. HP2 represents a chromosome with only germline variants, while HP1-1 represents the chromosome that has acquired the somatic mutation. This successfully separates the variants onto their respective parental chromosomes.
        *   **Tumor Purity Prediction Equation:** The phased haplotypes provide the necessary input for a tumor purity prediction model. The diagram shows this step leading to an estimation of the proportion of different cell populations (one with the somatic mutation and one without).
    *   **High Purity Path (Right):**
        *   **LOH Detection:** This parallel path is specifically for handling "High purity" samples. It depicts Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), where one copy of a chromosome (or a segment) is lost in the tumor cells. This is shown by a pair of homologous chromosomes where one is faded and marked with a dashed line, indicating its loss.
        *   **Iterative Refinement Loop:** An orange arrow shows that the information from LOH detection feeds back into the main workflow, specifically influencing the "Phasing" and subsequent purity prediction. In a high-purity LOH scenario, nearly all reads would belong to a single haplotype (the one that wasn't lost), which provides strong evidence for phasing and helps in accurately calling somatic variants that might otherwise be difficult to distinguish from germline variants. The output of this path is shown as a population of exclusively tumor cells.

*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The slide details a sophisticated bioinformatics pipeline for identifying somatic mutations. It highlights that long-read sequencing enables "phasing," which is the process of assigning variants to specific chromosomes. The workflow includes a special iterative refinement loop involving "LOH Detection" to improve accuracy in challenging high-purity tumor samples, where standard methods may fail. The ultimate goal is to use this refined information to accurately predict tumor purity.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide outlines a computational strategy for somatic variant analysis that leverages long-read sequencing. The key takeaways are:

*   **Phasing is Key:** Long-read sequencing allows for the phasing of variants, which is critical for distinguishing the chromosomal origin of somatic mutations relative to germline variants.
*   **Handling High Purity:** The pipeline incorporates a specific module for Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) detection, which is particularly useful for refining variant calls in high-purity samples.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Information from LOH detection is used in a feedback loop to iteratively refine the phasing and subsequent analysis, improving the overall accuracy.
*   **Foundation for Purity Prediction:** The entire workflow—from sequencing to filtering, calling, and phasing—serves as the foundation for applying a "Tumor Purity Prediction Equation," which was introduced conceptually in the previous slide.

### **Title**
Result: Haplotagging somatic and LOH

### **Visualizations**

This slide presents a visualization from a genome browser (such as IGV), demonstrating the successful application of the previously described workflow on real sequencing data. The image shows long sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome and separated by haplotype.

**Figure 1: Haplotagging of Somatic Variants and a Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Event**

The visualization is split into four main tracks, representing phased sequencing reads. The horizontal axis represents a region of the genome. Each thin horizontal bar is a single long sequencing read. Vertical colored tick marks on the reads indicate genetic variants (i.e., differences from the reference genome).

*   **Tracks:** The reads are separated into four groups based on their inferred haplotype of origin:
    *   **HP1 (light purple background):** Reads assigned to Haplotype 1.
    *   **HP2 (light red background):** Reads assigned to Haplotype 2.
    *   **HP1-1 (light blue background):** A refined or sub-grouped set of reads from Haplotype 1.
    *   **HP2-1 (light green background):** A refined or sub-grouped set of reads from Haplotype 2.

*   **Annotations and Interpretation:**
    *   **Somatic Variant (Left):** An arrow points to a specific genomic position on the left side. At this position, a variant (indicated by red vertical lines) is present in many reads assigned to HP1 but is absent from all reads assigned to HP2. This is the classic signature of a heterozygous somatic mutation that occurred on Haplotype 1.
    *   **LOH (Right):** A large arrow indicates a region of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). In this genomic region, there is a dramatic drop-off in the number of reads assigned to HP1, while the coverage for HP2 remains high. This visually demonstrates that the tumor cells have lost the copy of the chromosome corresponding to Haplotype 1.
    *   **Somatic Variant in LOH region (Right):** Within the LOH region, another arrow points to a second somatic variant (indicated by green vertical lines). This variant is present on the remaining Haplotype 2 reads. This shows the ability of the method to detect mutations that arise on the single remaining chromosome copy after an LOH event.

*   **Key Message of the Visualization:** The visualization provides powerful evidence for the success of the analysis pipeline. It shows that long-read sequencing data can be used to phase reads into distinct haplotypes (haplotagging). This phasing makes it possible to not only identify somatic variants but also to assign them to a specific parental chromosome. Furthermore, the method can clearly detect and visualize large-scale structural changes like LOH and identify additional somatic mutations within these complex regions. The lower tracks (HP1-1 and HP2-1) likely represent the final, refined output of the iterative process described in the previous slide, cleanly separating the cellular populations.

### **Summary of Key Messages**

This slide serves as a "proof of concept" for the methodology outlined previously. The key takeaways are:

*   **Successful Haplotagging:** The method effectively separates long sequencing reads into their respective haplotypes (HP1 and HP2).
*   **Phased Somatic Variant Detection:** It demonstrates the clear identification of a somatic variant on a specific haplotype (HP1).
*   **Visualization of LOH:** The pipeline can detect and visualize a large LOH event, a common and important feature in cancer genomes, by showing the specific loss of one haplotype's reads.
*   **Analysis of Complex Events:** The slide shows the ability to identify a second somatic variant that occurred *after* the LOH event, highlighting the robustness of the approach for dissecting complex tumor evolution.
